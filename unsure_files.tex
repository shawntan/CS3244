no, mi folk have infinit budget of death, and thei also get part
of their budget alloc "upgrad", "mainten", and "new purchas",
and a lot of ibm mainfram purchas ar actual "leas" and so
is the softwar.

basic, the engin who have tight budget, i.e. the coder and
design of a compani, bitch and moan when thei drop 15,000 on a 
sparc 1 onli to see a faster machin appear a year later.  mi type
upgrad onc everi 5-10 year, and their cost ar amort and
depreci over a longer period, and the budget offic justifi
the expens becaus thei actual us the machin for account,

now, if the budget offic wa depend on the engin for some

hi there

(i post thi to comp.window.x.intrins but got no respons, so i'm post
here.)

i'm want to connect a digitis made for pc into my workstat (an hp 720).
it is my understand the x window can understand a varieti of input devic
includ digitis tablet.  howev, thi digitis make us of the serial
port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special devic driver.

the hp manual page sai that the hp x server will accept x input from
devic list in the /usr/lib/x11/x*devic file (* = displai number).
i shouldn't think i would be abl to simpli insert /dev/rs232c as an input
devic in thi file and expect a digitis to work.  but mayb i'm wrong.  am i?

what i would like to know is: doe anybodi out there have a digitis connect
to their workstat for us as a pointer for x (rather than just as input to a
specif x applic)?  if so, what were the step requir for instal?
did you need a special devic driver?  did the manufactur suppli it?  ar
there gener public domain devic driver around?  (i understand that
digitis gener us onli a coupl of standard format.)

ani help would be greatli appreci.

have you tri clean the print head? with the swii driver, it's
and option in the print dialog box. sometim i had to do it sever
time to get the crud out. ye it wast ink, but it beat those

  anoth idea is to print a coupl of page with just a big

no, but...

you can alloc real static data within code segment!
when you need more dynam memori you can alloc data on the global heap.

you can forget most of what wa written about memori manag. under 3.1
you have page virtual memori. you can lock everi block without hamper
the memori manag. you can us far pointer everytim without alwai lock/
unlock the memori block.
