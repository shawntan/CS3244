i don't know if there's a correspond patch for solari 2.1, but thi
sound like the follow bug which is supposedli fix in 100492-06, the
solari 1.x olwm jumbo patch:

	1108642 - window system can hang in an errant pointer grab

actual, i suspect that the ow 3.1 problem mai be differ, sinc the
readm file sai that thi patch is just a suno 4.x version of the ow 3.1
olwm (but mayb that line came from an earlier version of the patch, and
thei forgot to take it out in the -06 version).
