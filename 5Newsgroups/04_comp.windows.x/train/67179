  the mit tape come with document written by keith packard on the share
  memori extens to x. look in:  mit/doc/extens/mit-shm.ms
  i found thi invalubl. unfortun, there is a bit of work to set up the
  share memori segment, make an ximag from it, etc. also, there is an
  extens queri to determin if the server support it, but you still need to
  test if the server is run on the same host and if share memori is enabl
  in the kernel. i have written layer of convienc routin which make all thi
  transpar.
  as for the xview code, well, i doubt that would be consid interest.
  the interest stuff is done in a c object librari. peopl interest in thi
  code can email me.
