hi, 

i'm try to write a motif program on an interact unix machin, and i'm
observ veri strang behavior when my program attempt to expos a
drawingarea. name, some xlib oper work, and some do not. in
particular, the expos consist of two xfillrectangl call follow by some
xdrawpoint call, and for reason unknown to me the point call ar fail
whenev a pulldown or popup up menu is (click on and) move in the
rightward direct over the draw area, but after the move, is still on
some part of the draw area. thi also happen less consist when the
pulldown/popup is move in the leftward direct.

assum that my code is not do anyth incred odd, is thi a server
bug?

thank,
