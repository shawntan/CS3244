okai, i look through the faq and didn't see thi, but i know it
come up befor...

xalloccolor is suppos to do the follow in order:
    try to find an exact match read-onli color cell. (within hardwar limit)
    try to alloc a read-onli colorcel and set it to match.
	and when all els fail, 
    return the colorcel with the best match from the read-onli color 
    alreadi alloc in the colormap.

thi sound good in theori.  it doesn't seem to work thi wai
though.  if there is no exact match alreadi in the colormap, and 
no unalloc cell, then xalloccolor fail, even when it ha 
alreadi alloc sever other cell alreadi, and there ar dozen 
of read-onli cell alreadi in the colormap.

is thi a bug?  a featur?  a misunderstand on my part?

ani help appreci,
