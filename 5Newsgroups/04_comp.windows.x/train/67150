what "it mai think is right" mai be exactli what the user want.
assum that your applic "ha reason to know better" is, imho,
anti-social.  if i start your applic with a -geometri option ar
you go to ignor that as well?

there's realli no wai to forc a window manag to do much of anyth
if it's manag your window.  you can ask, you can hint, but there's
no guarante that you're go to get what you want.
