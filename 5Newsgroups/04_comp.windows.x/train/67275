tcpview is the result of sever problem we had at uw.  we have sever
network gener sniffer which ar heavili us to help debug problem on
sever hundr subnet. these ar good tool, but thei ar 1) heavi, 
2) hard to find when you need on, 3) limit in their softwar expand,
4) difficult to us to upload data for analysi, 5) cannot be remot
oper, and 6) cannot resolv name with dn, requir much manual 
manipul of the name tabl.  we also sometim us tcpdump, but we found 
it 1) too difficult for most peopl, 2) did not have enough inform for
mani protocol, 3) could not be us interact, 4) could not handl
tcp stream and 5) could not read sniffer file.  howev, tcpdump did do
a reason job of decod a larg number of protocol, and could be easili
modifi.  tcpview is an attempt to resolv these problem
by ad a motif interfac to tcpdump and expand it featur.

tcpview ha been test on a decstat 5000 and sun 4 under ultrix 4.2 and
suno 4.1 respect.  it should work on the same system as tcpdump.
it compil with cc and gcc on the dec and sun.  to build tcpview you will
need motif 1.1 or better.

the follow file ar avail for anonym ftp from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/network

tcpview-1.0.tar.z	tcpview and tcpdump sourc code
tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.z	sun4 binari
tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.z	dec mip ultrix 4.2 binari

what tcpview add to tcpdump:
- easier interfac
- enhanc protocol decod
- hex displai of frame
- captur base on time, number of frame, or user interrupt
- can show ethernet address with manufactur's name
- ethernet address host tabl
- can easili follow a stream, highlight out-of-order frame
- can send tcp data to an extern file or filter for addit
	process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
chang to tcpdump 2.2.1

new featur:

now read and write network gener sniffer file.  when us with '-r', the 
file type will be automat detect.

can now read in (and us) an snmp mib file.

the hex format ha been chang.

new time option have been ad.

option were ad to allow view and process of the data in tcp packet.

bug were fix in the rel tcp sequenc number. (-s flag)

new flag:
-r	read sniffer file.  not usual need, except for read from stdin
-ttt	print delta time
-tttt	print time rel to the first frame
-w	write a sniffer save file (us with -w)
-x	print frame (minu link-level header) in hexdump format.  
	sampl output:

-x	print tcp data in hexdump format (us with -z)
-z	write tcp data to stdout (us with -t to elimin timestamp)
-z	write frame and tcp data to stdout
