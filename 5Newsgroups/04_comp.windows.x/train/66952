on can't.  the applic mai not have been start from a termin
emul; if it wa, the termin emul mai not still exist, and if
it doe it mai be in no condit to be "pop[ped] to the top" (eg, it
mai be iconifi).  and even if you can, it mai not do what you want -
consid a virtual-root window manag like tvtwm, with the relev
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outsid the real
desktop.

some (but not all) x termin emul provid environ variabl
give a window id.  even if such a thing is present in the
environ, it mai not be what you want; it mai correspond to a window
on a differ server, for exampl.
