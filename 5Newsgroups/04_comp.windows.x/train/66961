i would suggest skip olwm and get olvwm instead. thi version of the
olwm window manag implement a virtual desktop that i find realli handi even
on larg monitor. 

thi version is also avail at export.lc.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.z.
the readm file also suggest get the file in /contrib/xview3.

in my case, i built the x server first, xview second, then olvwm. all of these
were instal into /usr/x5. onc i verifi the server work correctli,
i happili issu "rm -rf /usr/openwin/*".

us gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the abov result in a window system that 
is, for all intent and purpos, ident to openwindow 3.0 and that is     
incred faster. there is a bit of tweak you will have to do if you want
thing to work _exactli_ like openwindow, but not much.
