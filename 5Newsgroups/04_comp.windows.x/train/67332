we have an old sun3/60 here which get occasion us.  when x11r5 is start
on it ani consol messag dure startup ar undelet.  after x is fulli
start we run an xterm as the "consol" - the problem is that ani messag
that arriv befor thi start go to the plain consol.  "refresh window" fail
to remov them.  the messag ar a real pain sinc thei sit in the middl of
the screen obscur anyth els below them.

at boot time the 3/60 list two framebuff  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.
we're run x in color, and i suspect that mayb the offend messag ar
on the b/w framebuff, and therebi not get delet.

my question is: ha anyon els seen thi, and is there an easi wai to get rid
of these messag?
