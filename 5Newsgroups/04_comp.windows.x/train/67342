i us to think thi wai, and not just about x. for exampl, incorrect
english construct such as "it rain" or "it's window id" annoi me.
howev, there come a time when popular usag start to dictat the wai
thing realli ar in the world. inde, the fact that x won out over new
wa realli down to popular opinion (i know, we all think it's(!) technic
superior as well!).

on a relat topic, who is to sai that "color" is more or less correct
than "colour" - be irish, and henc us english english as oppos
to american english, i alwai us the latter except, of cours, for api
term such as "xalloccolor" and "colormap".

in a world that us the term "window" to refer to microsoft window,
perhap the time ha come to accept "x window" as a valid term for x.
i think that thi is a more concis and unclutt term than, sai,
"the x window system" and, let's face it, almost everyon us it.
ultim, we all need product sale to more than just x-liter
peopl. in thi respect, product recognit is import and a short,
snappi, descript titl ("x" is posit obscur) will help
when deal with the averag punter (it's sad - i thought i wa a
softwar engin!). inde it is unfortun that x did not becom
popularli known as window and let ms worri about whether it should
be call "microsoft window" or "the microsoft window system" or
how about just plain "microsoft"!

to summaris (or should that be "summar") the point of thi messag:
i think there ar far more press issu face the x commun than
worri about subtl distinct in the name of the window system
(or should that be "window system"). whatev get recognis is
fine by me. i agre that on should be care in interpret what
trade paper sai. howev, i would be reluct to come to thi
conclus pure on the basi of how thei name the x window system.
