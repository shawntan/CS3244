accord to the osf/motif style guid, on should us cursor shape to give
the user a visual clue of what is happen or what is expect of him. so
a "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the applic is busi, or a
"caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expect in
anoth. defin cursor for widget ha to be done at rather low level.
so defin a cursor for all widget in an applic but not for a certain
subpart of it, is a rather complic matter. when cursor have been defin
for some window, e.g. a "crosswir" cursor for a drawingarea, thing get even
more complic. my intuit sai that thing should be easier, but is thi
so? if anyon ha a solid and complet solut to my problem, pleas let me
know. the topic on "busi cursor" in the sever faq's ar not help, sinc
thei onli work for applic where all window have the cursor window
attribut set to 'none'.
