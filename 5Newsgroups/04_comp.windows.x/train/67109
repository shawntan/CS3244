i am try to build and us imak (x11r4) on an ibm rs/6000 run aix v3.2.
i am have the follow 2 problem.

(1) mani of my imakefil's have contruct like
                /**/#thi is a makefil
        at the start of line to pass makefil comment thru the c
        preprocessor and into the makefil.  most of the c preprocessor that
        i have us will not treat such a # as appear at the start of the
        line.  thu the c preprocessor doe not treat the hash symbol as the
        start of a direct. 

        howev the ibm cpp strip the comment and treat the hash symbol
        as the start of a direct.  the cpp fail when it determin
        that "thi" is not a known direct.  i have temporarili hack my
        imak to handl thi situat but would like to come up with a better
        fix.

(2) sever imakefil us /**/ as a paramet to a macro when a particular
        us of the macro doe not need a valu for the paramet.  the aix cpp
        give warn about these situat but continu to work ok.

if you ar familiar with these problem and have solut, i would appreci
inform about on your solut.  (perhap, thi is solv in a later
version of imak that i have not review.)  also, do you know of other cpp's
that behav similarli?

sinc i do not have easi access to new, a respons to
'white_billi@po.gi.prc.com' would be appreci.
