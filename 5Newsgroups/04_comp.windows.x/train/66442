sug cd 1992.1 is x11r5 and gnu on a cdrom, price at $50 to sug
member, includ a caddi!

sug's emphasi ha alwai been on suppli the greatest possibl
servic and valu-ad to our member.  last year, the sug 1991 disk
contain plug-and-plai x11r4, 20mb of addit essenti binari,
almost 200mb of sun patch, fulli-index archiv of sun-relat net
post, price at onli $250.

our aim thi year ha been to reduc the price for disk which can be
produc inexpens, but to continu to suppli as much valu-ad

set, the first contain what's readi and need now, the second
avail later in '92, contain more sparc binari and other
us materi not found on previou disk.

the sug 1992.1 disk, which wa assembl by robert a. bruce, contain
a lot of essenti sourc code, and we decid it would be a great
servic to make it avail right awai to our member (and thi
price make thi a good opportun to becom a member!) for $50 per
disk (includ on of those hard-to-find caddi!).  if you ar not a
