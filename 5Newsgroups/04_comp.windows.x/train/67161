let's sai i have two rectangl on the canva(see abov) 
on intersect the other...
now, i would like to delet on of the rectangl.
the wai i do it is to creat anoth gc wherein i us the
gxxor logic function and simpli redraw the rectangl us the newli
creat graphic context thu delet it for all appar purpos.
a problem with thi approach is that at the point of intersect the pixel 
locat belong to the other rectangl also becom white, which is 
someth that should be avoid.

is there ani wai i can avoid thi problem without have to redraw the other
rectangl too?
i also would not like to gener an expos event for the affect area
as thi degrad perform veri badli...


thank you...
