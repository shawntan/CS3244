i just implement thi and it seem i can just about achiev the displai
rate (20 400x400x8 frame / sec on ipx) that i get with sunview, though
it's a bit "choppi" at time. also, load the data, make an ximag,
then xput'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersom, so the anim is
slower to load than with sunview. is there a better wai to load in the
data?

share memori putimag (also mention by nkisseb@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,
nick kisseberth) look interest, but i need someon to point me to some
document. is thi method like to give better result than server-
resid pixmap? i'd also be interest in look at the xview code
mention abov...

thank for the help so far. if i get someth decent put togeth, i'll
definit post it to the net.
