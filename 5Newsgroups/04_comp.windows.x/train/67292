there ar sever product you might investig.  if you've got
$20,000 per seat and high-end hardwar, gain momentum might be a good
choic.  it isn't compat with hypercard, but ha a similar
architectur (and *wai* more function).  i don't have contact
inform, but thei were recent purchas by sybas who shouldn't
be too hard to find.

if you're run new on sparc, check out hyperlook
(hyperlook@ture.com).  it us postscript as a script languag
which is good if you need to do lot of displai orient script,
but not so good for non-programm.  it wa $995, last i heard.

you might also look at our product metacard.  we're alpha-test
direct import of hypercard stack (we've even made the test releas
avail for anonym ftp), so we're obvious the closest in
function.  metacard run on most unix workstat and cost
$495.  email to info@metacard.com for more detail.
