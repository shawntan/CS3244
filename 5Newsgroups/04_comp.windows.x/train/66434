try the 'm.sc. comput scienc' cours at the real newcastl univers.
it's a convers cours, but at least thei teach real program.

in the space of 9 month we were taught pascal, simula, prolog, miranda.
also, some basic low level stuff (68000) wa cover as well.

thei also did concurr program and oper system, some softwar
engin, plu quit a few option unit, includ databas theori,
and some stuff about comm.   

the pascal is to be replac by c/c++ i think next year - i learn't thi (and 
x window program as well)
anywai via a good select of project over the final three month - depend
on your tast, the select of skill learn't can be quit wide reach.

the on critisc i would level at the cours, which i would have thought
invalu, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industri -
thi would probabl need a slightli longer project period (sai six month), but
would enhanc the prestig and us of an alreadi excel and thorough
cours.

ye, i know thi sound like a plug for the cours, why not!
