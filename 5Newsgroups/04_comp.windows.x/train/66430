subject:  24)! how do i make a screendump or print my applic?

	the xwd client in the x11 distribut can be us to select a window 
or the background. it produc an xwd-format file of the imag of that window. 
the file can be post-process into someth us or print with the xpr 
client and your local print mechan. you can us thi command:
		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &
and then spend 10 second or so set up your screen; the entir current
displai will be save into the file output.xwd. note that xwd also ha an
undocu (befor r5) -id flag for specifi the window id on the 
command-line. [there ar also unoffici patch on export to xwd for 
specifi the delai and the portion of the screen to captur.]

	two publicli-avail program which allow interact definit of 
arbitrari portion of the displai and built-in delai ar asnap and xgrabsc.
there ar sever version of xgrabsc; version 2.2, avail on export [8/92]
is the most recent.
	xsnap includ some asnap featur and supersed it; it also render 
xpm output [version unknown]. it is avail on export or avahi.inria.fr;
see xsnap-pl2.tar.z.
	a screen-dump and merg/edit program combin featur of xwd and xpr
is avail from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.z. inform: 
soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.
	xprint, by alberto accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is avail
from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.z.

	to post-process the xwd output of some of these tool, you can us xpr,
which is part of the x11 distribut. also on sever archiv ar xwd2ps
and xtop, which produc encapsul postscript with trim suitabl for 
us in present (see export.lc.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.z and
contrib/imagemagick.tar.z). also us is the pbmplu packag on mani archiv
server; and the xim packag contain level 2 color postscript output.

	the xv program can grab a portion of the x displai, manipul it, and
save it in on of the avail format. imagemagick ha similar capabl.

	also: 

	bristol technolog (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offer xprinter 
2.0, an xlib api for postscript and pcl printer; a demo is on ftp.uu.net
in vendor/bristol/xprinter.

	colorsoft 9619-459-8500) offer openprint packag includ a screen-
captur facil, imag-process, and support for postscript and 
non-postscript printer.

	some vendor' implement of x (e.g. decwindow and openwindow) 
includ session manag or other desktop program which includ "print portion
of screen" or "take a snapshot" option. some platform also have tool which 
can be us to grab the frame-buffer directli; the sun system, for exampl, 
have a 'screendump' program which produc a sun raster file. some x termin 
have local screen-dump util to write postscript to a local serial printer.

	some vendor' implement of lpr (e.g. soni) includ direct 
support for print xwd file, but you'll typic need some other packag 
to massag the output into a us format which you can get to the printer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  25)  how do i make a color postscript screendump of the x displai?

	if you need color postscript in particular, you can 
	- grab the screen-imag us a program which can produc color 
postscript, such as xgrabsc and xv 
	- grab the screen-imag us xwd and post-process xwd into color ps.
you can do thi us xwd2ps or the xtop program from the imagemagick 
distribut. the pbmplu packag is also good for thi, as is the xim packag.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  26)  how do i make a screendump includ the x cursor?

	thi can't be done unless the x server ha been extend. consid 
instead a system-depend mechan for, e.g.,  captur the frame-buffer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  27)  how do i convert/view mac/tiff/gif/sun/pict/img/fax imag in x?

	the likeliest program is an incarn of jef poskanz's us++ 
portabl bitmap toolkit, which includ a number of program for convert 
among variou imag format. it includ support for mani type of bitmap, 
grai-scale imag, and full-color imag. pbmplu ha been updat recent;
the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplu10dec91.tar.z.
	anoth tool is san diego supercomput center's imtool ('imconv' in 
particular), which packag the function of pbm into a singl binari.
it's avail anonym ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).

	us for view some imag-format is jim frost's xloadimag, a
version of which is in the r4 directori contrib/client/xloadimag; there ar 
later version avail, includ contrib/xloadimag.3.03.tar.z on export.  
graem gill's updat to an earlier version of xloadimag ar also on export; 
see xli.readm and xli.tar.z.uu; version 1.14 wa releas 2/93.

	xv (x imag viewer), written by bradlei@ci.upenn.edu (john bradlei), 
can read and displai pictur in sun raster, pgm, pbm, ppm, x11 bitmap, tiff, 
gif and jpeg. it can manipul on the imag: adjust, color, intens, 
contrast, aspect ratio, crop). it can save imag in all of the aforement 
format plu postscript. it can grab a portion of the x displai, manipul on 
it, and save it in on of the avail format. the program wa updat 5/92; 
see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.z on export.lc.mit.edu.

	the fuzzi pixmap manipul, by michael mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.
convers and manipul packag, similar to pbmplu.  version 1.0 avail
via ftp as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.z, 
and ucsd.edu:graphic/fbm.tar.z.

	the img softwar set, by paul ravel <ravel@venera.isi.edu>, read
and write it own imag format, displai on an x11 screen, and doe some imag
manipul.  version 1.3 is avail via ftp on expo.lc.mit.edu as
contrib/img_1.3.tar.z, along with larg collect of color imag.

	the utah rle toolkit is a convers and manipul packag similar 
to pbmplu.  avail via ftp as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, 
weedeat.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebi.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.

	xim, the x imag manipul, by philip thompson, doe essenti 
interact displai, edit, filter, and convert of imag. there is 
a version in the x11r4 contrib area; but a more recent version (us r4 and 
motif 1.1) is avail from gi.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). xim read/write gif, 
xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (write level 2 ep) and other format and also ha a
librari and command-line util for build your own applic.

	imagemagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristi@dupont.com can be retriev from 
export's contrib area. it is a collect of util to transform and displai
imag on ani x server. the tool us the miff format; filter to and from miff
from other popular format (ppm, tiff, gif, sun raster, etc) ar includ.

	xtiff is a tool for view a tiff file in an x window.  it wa written
to handl as mani differ kind of tiff file as possibl while remain
simpl, portabl and effici.  xtiff illustr some common problem
with build pixmap and us differ visual class.  it is distribut
as part of sam leffler's libtiff packag and it is also avail on
export.lc.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sourc.x. [db@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]
xtiff 2.0 wa announc in 4/91; it includ xlib and xt version.

subject:  28)  how can i chang the titlebar of my xterm window?

	the solut involv send an escap sequenc to xterm which will
caus it to updat the properti which the window manag reli upon for the
string which appear in the window titlebar.
	a solut is as easi as type thi in an xterm run a shell:
		echo "esc]2;text^g"
where esc is the escap kei, text is the string you wish to have displai,
and ^g is a control-g (the bel charact).

	here is a more complic csh alia which chang the titlebar to
the current work directori when you chang directori:
		alia newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n esc]2\;$cwd^g'

	the digit '2' in these string indic to xterm that it should 
chang onli the titl of the window; to chang both the titl and the name 
us in the icon, us the digit '0' instead, and us '1' to chang onli the 
icon name.

	note: anoth wai to do thi, which prevent an incorrect displai of
the local directori if a modifi `cd` is us in a subshel, is to wrap the
escap sequenc into the ps1 prompt itself.

	note: on an ibm rs/6000 is mai be necessari to begin the sequenc with
a ^v.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  29)  where can i find the xterm control sequenc?

the best sourc of such inform is in your r5 sourc in the file 
ctlseq.ms; a postscript version is in mit/hardcopi/client/ctlseq.ps.z.

o'reilli's volum 3, the x user's guid, includ an r5 version of the control 
sequenc; the standard volum will be avail 3/93, and a motif version of 
the book is avail now. the current (r4) guid includ an outdat version
of the control sequenc. [1/93]

other good sourc of inform includ the r4 version of that document
and also the file in the r4 sourc call mit/client/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a 
compil put togeth by skip montanaro (ge cr&d) list the vt100 
sequenc. it date from r3 but is fairli accur.  a hardcopi version wa 
publish in the decemb 1989 xnextev (the xug newslett).

in a pinch, a vt100 manual will do.

[last updat 10/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  30)- why doe the r3 xterm, et al, fail against the r4 server?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  31)  how can i us charact abov ascii 127 in xterm ?

	in order to us special charact such as the o-umlaut, you need to 
"stty pass8" but also to us a charcel iso8859 font, such as 
	xterm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
	xterm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
[the famili is intention unspecifi in thi exampl.]

in addit, you mai want to set thi in your shell:
	setenv lc_ctype iso_8859_1

        for a given charact abov 127, you can determin the kei to us with 
the alt modifi by find the equival charact below 127 (try us
`man ascii`). for exampl, o-umlaut (v) is alt-v and the section charact (') 
is alt-'.

(gildea@expo.lc.mit.edu); 6/92]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  32)  why ar my xterm menu so small?

	you ar probabl set the geometri small accident. if you give 
a resourc specif like thi:
		xterm*geometri: 80x24
then you ar ask for all widget under xterm to have their geometri set to
80x24. for the main window, thi is ok, as it us charact for it size. 
but it popup menu don't; thei ar in pixel and show up small. to set onli
the termin widget to have the specifi geometri, name it explicitli:
		xterm*vt100.geometri: 80x24

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  33)  how can i print the current select?

	you could past it into an xterm after execut the lpr command. 
howev, a program by richard hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specif for 
manipul the select will help; e.g. 
	% xselect primari | lpr
find the primari select and print it. thi command can be place in a 
window-manag menu or in shell-script. xselect also permit the set of
the select and other properti. a version is on export.
	also avail is ria.cc.uwo.ca:pub/xget_select.tar.z, which can be
adapt to do thi.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  34)  how doe xt us environ variabl in load resourc?

	you can us sever environ variabl to control how resourc ar 
load for your xt-base program -- xfilesearchpath, xuserfilesearchpath, and 
xapplresdir.  these environ variabl control where xt look for 
applic-default file as an applic is initi.  xt load at most
on app-default file from the path defin in xfilesearchpath and anoth from
the path defin in xuserfilesearchpath.

	set xfilesearchpath if softwar is instal on your system in such a 
wai that app-default file appear in sever differ directori hierarchi.
suppos, for exampl, that you ar run sun's open window, and you also 
have some r4 x applic instal in /usr/lib/x11/app-default. you could 
set a valu like thi for xfilesearchpath, and it would caus xt to look up 
app-default file in both /usr/lib/x11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherev your
openwinhom is locat):
	setenv xfilesearchpath /usr/lib/x11/%t/%n:$openwinhom/lib/%t/%n

the valu of thi environ variabl is a colon-separ list of pathnam.  the pathnam contain replac charact as follow (see 
xtresolvepathnam()):

        %n      the valu of the filenam paramet, or the
                applic's class name.
        %t      the valu of the file "type".  in thi case, the
                liter string "app-default"
        %c      custom resourc (r5 onli)
        %s      suffix.  none for app-default.
        %l      languag, local, and codeset (e.g. "ja_jp.euc")
        %l      languag part of %l  (e.g. "ja")
        %t      the territori part of the displai's languag string
        %c      the codeset part of the displai's languag string

	let's take apart the exampl.  suppos the applic's class name is 
"myterm". also, suppos open window is instal in /usr/openwin. (notic the 
exampl omit local-specif lookup.)
	/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n        mean /usr/lib/x11/app-default/myterm
	$openwinhom/lib/%t/%n    mean /usr/openwin/lib/app-default/myterm

	as the applic initi, xt tri to open both of the abov 
app-default file, in the order shown.  as soon as it find on, it read it 
and us it, and stop look for other.  the effect of thi path is to 
search first in /usr/lib/x11, then in /usr/openwin.

	let's consid anoth exampl. thi time, let's set 
xuserfilesearchpath so it look for the file myterm.ad in the current work 
directori, then for myterm in the directori ~/app-default.
	setenv xuserfilesearchpath ./%n.ad:$home/app-default/%n

	the first path in the list expand to ./myterm.ad.  the second expand 
to $home/app-default/myterm.  thi is a conveni set for debug 
becaus it follow the imak convent of name the app-default file 
myterm.ad in the applic's sourc directori, so you can run the applic
from the directori in which you ar work and still have the resourc load
properli.  note: when look for app-default file with xuserfilesearchpath,
for some  bizarr reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defin so %t and
%s ar useless.

	with r5, there's anoth twist.  you mai specifi a custom 
resourc valu.  for exampl, you might run the "myterm" applic like thi:
	myterm -xrm "*custom: -color"

	if on of your pathnam specif had the valu
"/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%c" then the expand pathnam would be
"/usr/lib/x11/app-default/myterm-color" becaus the %c substitut charact 
take on the valu of the custom resourc.

	the default xfilesearchpath, compil into xt, is:
		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c:\  (r5)
		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c:\  (r5)
		/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%c:\     (r5)
		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n:\
		/usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n:\
		/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n

	(note: some site replac /usr/lib/x11 with a projectroot in
thi batch of default set.)

	the default xuserfilesearchpath, also compil into xt, is 
		<root>/%l/%n%c:\  (r5)
		<root>/%l/%n%c:\  (r5)
		<root>/%n%c:\     (r5)
		<root>/%l/%n:\
		<root>/%l/%n:\
		<root>/%n:

	<root> is either the valu of xapplresdir or the user's home directori 
if xapplresdir is not set.  if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some valu other 
than the default, xt ignor xapplresdir altogeth.

	notic that the quick and dirti wai of make your applic find 
your app-default file in your current work directori is to set xapplresdir 
to ".", a singl dot.  in r3, all thi machineri work differ; for r3 
compatibilti, mani peopl set their xapplresdir valu to "./", a dot follow 
by a slash.

subject:  35)  how to i have the r4 xdm put a pictur behind the log-in window?

the answer li in chang xdm's xrdb resourc in the xdm-config file to run a
program to chang the background befor load the resourc; for exampl, 
your /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xdm-config file mai add the line 
	displaymanag.0.author: fals 
to permit unrestrict access to the displai befor log-in (bewar!) and also 
	displaymanag*xrdb:	/usr/lib/x11/xdm/new.xrdb
where that file doe someth (for all connect) along the line of:
	#!/bin/sh
	#come in with argument: -displai :0 -load /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xresourc
	/usr/bin/x11/xsetroot -displai $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/x11/xdm/new.bitmap
	/usr/bin/x11/xrdb $*
substitut xloadimag or xv for xsetroot, to tast.  note that thi is a 
gener hack that can be us to invok a consol window or ani other client.

subject:  36)  why isn't my path set when xdm run my .xsession file?

	when xdm run your .xsession it doesn't sourc your .cshrc or .login
file. you can set the path explicitli as you normal could for ani sh script;
or you can place all environ-set statement in a separ file and
sourc it from both the .xsession file and your shell configur file; or,
if you set your path in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your 
.xsession have path set simpli by make it a csh script, i.e. by start
your .xsession file off with "#!/bin/csh". 
	if thi doesn't work, also try start off with:
		#!/bin/sh
		# reset path:
		path=`csh -c 'echo $path'` ; export path

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  37)  how do i keep my $displai when i rlogin to anoth machin?

	there ar sever wai to avoid have to do a "setenv displai ..."
whenev you log in to anoth network unix machin run x.
	on solut is to us the client/xrsh on the r5 contrib tape.  it 
includ xrsh, a script to start an x applic on remot machin, and
xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm run rlogin to a remot machin.
a more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.
	on solut is to us the xrlogin program from der mous
(mous@larri.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). you can ftp caveat-emptor version from
132.206.1.1, in x/xrlogin.c and x/xrlogind.c. the program packag up $term and
$displai into a singl string, which is stuf into $term.  rlogin then 
propag $term normal; your .cshrc on the remot machin should contain
		eval `xrlogind`
where xrlogind is a program that check $term and if it is of the special 
format it recogn, unpack it and spit out setenv and unsetenv command to 
recreat the environ variabl. [11/90]

	in addit, if all you need to do is start a remot x process on 
anoth host, and you find
		rsh <host> -n /usr/bin/x11/xterm -displai $displai 
too simpl (displai must have your real hostnam), then thi version of xrsh 
can be us to start up remot x process. the equival usag would be 
		xrsh <host> xterm

  #! /bin/sh
  # start an x11 process on anoth host
  # date: 8 dec 88 06:29:34 gmt
  # from: chri torek <chri@mimsi.umd.edu>

subject:  38)  how can i design my own font?

	on wai is to us the "bitmap" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g.
sun's icon-editor tool, post-process with pbmplu) to design the individu 
charact and then to do some larg amount of post-process to concaten 
them into the bdf format. see olli jone's articl in the novemb 91 x 
journal for more inform.
	the r3 contrib/ area (in font/util/ and in client/xtroff) contain 
a number of us util, includ some to convert between bdf font format
and a simpl charact format which can be edit with ani text editor.
	an easier wai is to us the "xfed" client to modifi an exist font; a
version is on the r4 or r5 x11r5 contrib tape in contrib/client/xfed. xfed is 
avail for anonym ftp on ftp.informatik.uni-dortmund.de [129.217.64.63], 
possibl as file /pub/window/x/divers-x11-sourcen/xfed.tar.z. it can produc
bdf-format font which can be compil for a varieti of x server.
	the xfedor client from group bull permit creation of bitmap, cursor,
xpm1 pixmap, and font. binari for common machin ar on avahi.inria.fr in
/pub; in addit, the sourc (an old xlib implement) have been place 
[5/91] in export:/contrib. 
	if you ar a metafont user you can us "mftobdf" from the seetex
distribut to convert pk, gf, and pxl font to bdf format; the distribut
is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lc.mit.edu.

subject:  39)  why doe ad a font to the server not work (sic)?

	after you have built the font us your system's font-compil, 
instal it in some directori, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equival
(e.g. bldfamili for openwindow) in that directori, be sure to us `xset +fp 
$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the 
directori is alreadi in the path, us `xset fp rehash` so that the new font in
that directori ar actual found; it is thi last step that you're probabl 
leav out. (you can also us `xset q` to make sure that that directori is in 
the path.)
	sometim your "xset +fp $dir" command fail with a badvalu error:
		x error of fail request:badvalu
			(integ paramet out of rang for oper)
		major opcod of fail request:  51 (x_setfontpath)

	thi mean the x server cannot find or read your font directori, or
that your directori doe not look like a font directori to the server.  (the
mention of an "integ paramet" in the messag is spuriou.)

-- is the font directori you're specifi readabl from the server's file
   system?  rememb, it's the server, not the client, which interpret your
   font directori.  troubl in thi area is especi like when you issu an
   xset command with shell metacharact in it (e.g. "xset +fp ~/myfont") and
   the server is an x termin or manag by xdm.

-- is the directori realli a font directori?  if you're run an mit server
   (or most varieti of vendor server) look in the directori for the file
   "font.dir".  if you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (if you're
   run openwindow, look for the file "famili.list".  if you can't find
   it, run bldfamili(1).)

-- if you're in a site where some peopl run x11rn server and other run a
   proprietari server with nonstandard font format (openwindow, for
   exampl), make sure the font directori is right for the server you're us.
   hint: if the directori contain .pcf and/or .snf file, it won't work for
   open window.  if the directori contain .ff and/or .fb file, it won't work
   for x11rn.

us as an anyth-to-bdf convert, but requir access to a server that can 
understand the font file, thu is both more and less power than other tool

i want to be abl to do someth like thi:

	you can't do thi. the backgroundpixmap resourc is a pixmap of the

of thi, write a gener string to pixmap convert is imposs, sinc 
there is no accept convent for a file format for pixmap. therefor, 
neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set defin a string to pixmap 
convert, becaus there is no convert you cannot specifi thi valu as a
