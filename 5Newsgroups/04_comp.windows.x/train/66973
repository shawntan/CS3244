almost all window manag (twm, mwm, olwm and their deriv) support
escap sequenc for it. for your purpos put follow into your
.login (if you're us csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modifi it.

if ( "$term" == "xterm" ) then
	echo "^[]2;${lognam}@${host}^g^[]1;${host}^g"
endif

note, ^[ stand for <esc>, in vi you can enter it by press
ctrl-v and the <esc>. same for ^g, it mean ctrl-g. in vi:
press ctrl-v and then ctrl-g.
the first sequenc put the string into the titl bar the second
in the icon.

btw, you can also put the current work directori in the
titl bar if you make an alia for cd:

alia cd 'cd \!* ; echo "^[]2;${lognam}@${host}: ${cwd}^g"'

greet,
