i specif made the abov comment assum that perhap the code fragment
came from a simpl "open-draw-quit" client.  

as per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
then call the "window_redraw()" (or whatev) directli?  although, depend
on how the overal applic is structur, there mai be no problem with
render the object directli in respons to the button press.
