i have look through the faq section and have not
seen a answer for thi.

i have an x/motif applic that i have written.
i have a coupl of gif file (or pict) that i have
scan in with a color scanner.  now i would like
to be abl to convert the gif file into a format
that could be read into my applic and displai
on the background of it main window. prefer with
pixmap, or perhap as an ximag.

i have found function in the pbmplu program suit
to convert gif to xbm, but that is monochrom, and
i realli do need color.

i have look at xv, which read in gif, and write
out sever format, but have not found a wai to write
out a file which can be read in as a pixmap.

is there an easi wai to do thi?

email respons prefer.

thank!
