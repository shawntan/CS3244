it might be that the x termin doesn't support the "postscript
extens to x" product.  i us the 'dxpsview' program on a 
decstat 5000 to view postscript file but when i move to an
ncd x termin, i couldn't us it ani more.  so i ftp'd and
compil ghostscript (gnu softwar).  now we can view postscript
file on our x termin.

hope thi help.
