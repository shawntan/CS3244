   i need (probabl) to write on or more new motif widget on the hp-ux
   platform. do i need the motif privat header file and sourc,
   or can i make do with the public header that ar provid?
   "motif" includ xt in thi context.

ye.  you'll find it almost imposs without the sourc
at thi point.  it doe depend on how ambiti you ar and
how concern you ar about complianc with the gener
interfac and item like travers.

   on widget is a multi-column list (which lot of peopl have
   alreadi written, i am sure), and would therefor be probabl be
   a subclass of list rather than someth simpl like an xt class.
   is thi more difficult (in principl, not line of code)?

i'm not sure what you're ask.  you could creat someth
which is veri much like a true multi-column list by place
sever list within a geometri manag,  and put that
manag within an automat scroll window.  thi wouldn't
be good for veri larg list,  but you might consid thi
as an altern.

   altern, if anyon ha a multi-column list widget thei
   could sell me, thi might save me from have to write on!
   doe it by ani chanc exist in motif 1.2 alreadi (i do not
   yet have the spec)?

motif 1.2 doe not have a multi-column list in it.  have you
look at commerci set?  there ar also some pd 
widget set,  on of these might have a multi-column list
you could port.
