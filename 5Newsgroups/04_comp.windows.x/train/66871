imho thi whole discuss name "motif look like ms-windog" is total
stupid. the onli thing remot influenc here can be the motif window
manag, that featur an arrang of button and menu somewhat
similiar to thi of the ms-w windowmanag agent, howev it name is.
but mwm is onli a small part of motif, in fact, mwm and motif can work
without each other, and if on doesn't like mwm outfit for some reason,
he switch to anoth windowmanag. all thi doesn't influenc motif,
which is a toolkit of widget to write applic, and thi toolkit
is imho uncompar to ms-w, becaus it is much more wellorgan and
featur alot of goodi more than the ms-w interfac.

you cannot sai "a porsch look like a vw käfer" onli becaus thei have the
wheel and the gear at the same posit. motif and ms-w ar complet
differ world, onli on element of the motif world ha some gear and wheel
at the same posit as ms-w.
