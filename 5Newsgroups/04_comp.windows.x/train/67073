i am have a problem with the high order bit of a charact be 
clip when enter in an xterm window under motif. i have reprogram
the f1 kei to transmit a <ff> <be> charact sequenc by us the
follow line in .xdefault:

~ctrl ~shift ~alt <kei> f1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\

i merg in thi line with xrdb -merg and then creat the new xterm
which ha the remap f1 kei. the problem that aris is that the 
applic which is reciev input at the time onli see a <7f> <3e>
sequenc, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each
charact be filter or ignor.

when i run xev and press the f1 kei, i get the correct valu show 
up in the follow two kei event:

  keypress event, serial 14, synthet no, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycod 16 (keysym 0xffbe, f1), same_screen ye,
  xlookupstr give 0 charact:  ""

  keyreleas event, serial 16, synthet no, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycod 16 (keysym 0xffbe, f1), same_screen ye,
  xlookupstr give 0 charact:  ""

notic that the keysym be transmit is correct; 0xffbe.
but when i us the f1 kei while in vi or in a program i wrote to 
spit back the hex valu of keyboard input, i onli get <7f> <3e>.

doe anyon know why the high order bit is be filter and what
i can do to make sure that the entir 8bit make it through to
the final applic? ani help is greatli appreci.

pleas *email* ani respons.
