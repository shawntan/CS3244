what i like about gui's:

	- the abil to view and manipul a group of object, file,
	  text, directori, etc. and and manipul them in some wai
	  such as delet, copi, past, renam ...

	- the abil to have sever applic / screen visibl
	  and access at the same time.

	- be abl to do a standard set of function easili and
	  quickli on an unfamiliar oper system. i am familiar with
	  the command line of sever oper system but occasion
	  i will have to some work on a system that i almost never us.
	  if it ha a gui, i can usual accomplish what i want to do
	  fairli easili, the command line on the other hand often is
	  a long and pain experi.


what i hate about gui's:

	- have to switch between the mous and the keyboard. i guess
	  i have a strong on-hand prefer. i like to us a
	  comput with on hand and us the other for hold someth
	  like a piec of paper of a mug of tea. i have configur my
	  favorit editor so that most of the edit function can be
	  done with on hand such as navig, cut, past,
	  search, open and save file, etc. the main thing i
	  need to us both hand for is enter text.

	i guess i need to get on of those mice with, like, 20 button
	or someth and then i will have the best of both world.
