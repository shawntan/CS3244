 hi xpert!
   i have a sparc-1 with veri limit disk space on /usr partit.
   previous, i wa abl to run all x-window applic  and then 
   i upgrad my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realiz that , the hard
disk did not have enough space to load openwindow. my immedi altern
wa to load onli the neccessari file to boot the system. thi result in
not load openwindow. as a result of which none of the x-librari got load.

   i am try to load just the librari and includ file and bin/x11 file 
requir for run x-window and compil my program written for xlib and xaw.
in a desper effort to regain x-window, i retriev /usr/lib/libx*.* file from
the tape . /usr/bin/x11/*  and /usr/includ/x11/* . is thi enough for run x-window
 
 but i did not get /usr/lib/x11/font/  sub directori . these ar mainli 100dpi, 75dpi
 and misc. 

when i run xinit, the error messag sai /usr/lib/x11/font/100dpi etc ar not in the
default path. but the problem is i cannot load ani of those directori as there is no
disk space. 
ar there ani temporari suggest befor i get a 1.5 gb disk and load openwindow , to
just have my x-window run. 

thank
