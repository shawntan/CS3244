suppos you have an idl app with a realiz and map window that contain
xlib graphic.  a button widget, when press, will caus a new item
to be drawn in the window.  thi action clearli should not call xcopyarea() 
(or equiv) directli; instead, it should regist the exist of the new
item in a memori structur and let the expos event handler take care
of render the imag becaus at that time it is guarante that the
window is map.

the problem, of cours, is that no expos event is gener if the window
is visibl and map.  do you know the best wai to "tickl" a window so
that the expos event handler will be invok to draw thi new item?
