i'd appreci ani feedback on captur/playback tool for us with x client.

i have pull xtm from public domain but it appear to be set up to test
x server not x client. 

ani comparison/comment on regress test tool would be great -
particularli xtm, xrunner, autotest, and sri's capbak, smart and exdiff.
