the reason thei place their outsid corner at the locat you request
is becaus that's what the icccm sai thei should do.

thi code will almost certainli break.  call xmapwindow and then
xflush doe not guarante that the window is visibl and manag by the
window manag.  even if thi did work, there isn't a reliabl wai to
find out how much decor the window manag place around your
window, so you don't know how far to move it.  and what if the window
manag refus to move your window?
