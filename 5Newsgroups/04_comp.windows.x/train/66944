i am work on a project to provid an emerg manag
inform system.  in keep with more classic command and
control type system, we ar consid develop a dual screen monitor
system in order to provid a statu board on it's own monitor.  
i have a number of x level question regard thi:

(we ar devlop on unix system us x/motif. platform will be 
predominantli sun's, probabl with port to rs/6000 as well).

i am assum the standard dual monitor system ar configur
such that we ar talk about on x displai and multipl screen,
and not multipl x displai.   given thi:

	- is chang input focu from on screen to the other as simpl
	as track your mous from on screen to the other?  there's
	noth special that need to be done to shift focu between
	screen?

	- do i have to run separ window manag on the separ
	screen or ar there multiscreen window manag out there?
	what ar thei; who sell them...

	- is a multi-screen window manag the onli wai i can grab a
	window frame and move a window from on screen to the next?

	- is there ani wai for the applic to transpar see
	multipl screen as on logic x-y plane, or doe the hardwar
	onli provid for each screen to start at 0,0?

	- ani thought on the difficulti involv with design a
	system capabl of us either multipl screen or a singl
	screen (perhap run a virtual window manag to simul
	multipl screen instead)?  
	i am assum that thi is not a major issu - that i can reli
	on provid config file which will specifi for each
	configur the screen placement of each window in the
	applic.  ani thought or suggest from past experi
	ar more than welcom.
