thi is incorrect.  sun ha made no such claim regard devguid, and as 
manag of the devguid engin group i can state with author that
work on devguid is continu apac.  we had quit a strong show of interest
from the devguid user commun at last week's solari develop's confer.
devguid is be advoc not onli as a valuabl futur builder tool, but
as an import bit of transit technolog that will help sustain current
custom and facilit their migrat to the cose desktop environ.

if you have specif question about devguid avail, etc., you can 
contact tali aben, our devguid product market person, at (415) 336-3536.
