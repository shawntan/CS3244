hi !

i am us xview 3.0 on a sparc ipx under openwindow along with a xvideo board
from parallax which enabl me to us 24 bit color. i am have some problem
util the 24 bit color and would greatli appreci ani help in thi matter.

i us xview to creat a frame and then creat a canva pane insid which i us
to displai live video. my video input is 24 bit color.

the problem is that my top level frame creat as
	frame = (frame) xv_creat(null,frame,null);
seem to have a depth of 8 which is propag to my canva.

i would like to know how i can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bit.
i tri us the follow xlib code :

xvisualinfo visual_info;
int depth = 24;
colormap colormap;
xsetwindowattribut attrib;
unsign long valuemask = 0;
window *win;
xv_opaqu frame;

win = xv_get(frame,xv_xid);
xmatchvisualinfo(displai,screen,depth,truecolor,&visual_info);

/* so far so good */

colormap = xcreatecolormap(displai,win,visual_info,allocnon);

/* it di here with a badmatch error :( */

attrib.colormap = colormap;
valuemask |= cwcolormap;
xchangewindowattribut(displai,w,valuemask,&attrib);
xsetwindowcolormap(displai,win,colormap);


am i us a complet wrong approach here ? is it possibl to set the depth
and colormap for a window creat by xview ? what am i do wrong ?

thank in advanc for ani help that i can get. i would prefer a respons via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okai.

thank again,


alok.
