i don't know ani wai except to see what modifi ar on in th
keypress event.  of cours if there is some reason why you need to
alwai know the state of modifi even if your window don't have the
keyborad focu you can alwai ask for keypress event from the root
window.  then you get all the keypress and you alwai know what have
been press.

i think thi is just a question of how to implement xlookupstr.
you can alwai write anoth function that interpret the keypress
as you like.  you can look at the implement of xlookupstr from
the xlib sourc and then modifi it a littl bit.
