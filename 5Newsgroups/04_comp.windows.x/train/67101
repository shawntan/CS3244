some on ask me recent why thei when thei us xquerybestcursor to see
if thei could creat of a given size it seem to impli thei could, but the
server did not creat cursor of that size. investig show that some x
server will happili return ani size up to the size of the root window, while
other return some fix limit of more reason size. the interest thing
to me is that the same server binari act differ on differ hardwar -
a sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursor up to root window size ar ok, while a
sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. so far i've also seen thi behavior on
ncd and phase-x x termin and have been told it also occur on hp. 
actual, the ncd is even more liber - size much larger then the root
winodw ar gladli return as ok. is xquerybestcursor semi-broken or is thi
behavior correct? i'd realli like to see a 2000x2000 cursor!
