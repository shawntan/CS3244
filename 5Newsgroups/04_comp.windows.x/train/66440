i suspect thi is becaus vue creat a window (probabl overrideredirect)
that is the size of (or larger than) the root window. becaus the window
manag doe not know about thi, you cannot move, resiz etc. it. xv in the
mean time is busi chang your root window to whatev you have request
but you never get to see it becaus vue's window is overlaid on top of the root
window. 

contact hp support and see whether vue can support colour bitmap format
such as xpm, if thei cant then thei probabl creat all their colour
backdrop insid the code.
