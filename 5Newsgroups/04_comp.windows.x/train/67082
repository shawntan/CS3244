| what doe thi have to do with my origin question???  i previous
| state that i did an xcopyarea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen
| just to make sure that my imag had data, and it did.  thi is not
| a problem with expos event, it ha to do with xcopyplan not
| work!!!
| 
| doe anyon have a code fragment thei could send demonstr that
| xcopyplan work???  thi would be veri help!
| 
| thank!

what it ha to do with your origin question is thi: mani time 
begin x user (heck, experienc x user too!) write small test
program.  mani time thei forget to draw onli in respons to expos
event, and thu see unpredit result wherebi sometim the applic's
graphic show up, and sometim thei don't.  we're just try to
elimin all the "easi" explan  for why you're not see your
graphic. 

that be said, why don't you try copi differ plane to your
window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7
to see it you get ani output.  sinc you're dipslai onli a singl 
plane of your data, it's possibl that all the pixel valu in your
pixmap have the same valu for that color plane.
