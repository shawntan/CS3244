i expect the limit factor will be your server machin, not the network
itself. to give you a real-world exampl, here at quarterdeck we have
roughli 100 peopl us dvx to talk to a bunch of unix box, novel
file server, and each other. it's not _too_ much of a load on our
ethernet (with mayb 4 concentr, so you have 20-30 peopl on each
segment). if you had a badli load net, or the app you want to run
were veri network intens, you could run into some slowdown.

but the biggest problem would be the machin itself. sai you have a 486
33 with plenti of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. if you have
10 peopl run program off it, you're go to see some slowdown
becaus you're now on (effect) a 3.3 mhz 486. of cours, dvx will
attempt to see if task ar idl and make sure thei give up their time
slice, but if you have 10 work program run, you'll know it.

have said that, if you can tweak the program be run (by ad
in call to give up time slice when idl and that sort of
thing), you could probabl run 15-20 peopl on a given machin befor
you start see slowdown again (thi time from network bandwidth).
it all realli depend on what the program ar do (ie. you're go
to see a slowdown from x-bandwidth a lot sooner if your app ar all
do network thing also...)
