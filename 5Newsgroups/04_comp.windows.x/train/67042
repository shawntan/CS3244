glad to hear that it's work for you!

i couldn't find it on "export".  howev, simon leinen
<simon@liasun6.epfl.ch> ha ad an imakefil and an athena
version, and made it avail for ftp in the file
liasun3.epfl.ch:/pub/x/contrib/xrpc.tar.z.  (note the ".z"
suffix; you'll need gnu gzip -- also on liasun3 in /pub/gnu --
to uncompress it.)  

if thi doesn't work, send me a note and i'd be happi to mail you
a copi; but you probabl won't get it until the start of mai --
i'm on holidai as of tomorrow! :-)
