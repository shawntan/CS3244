the xview version 3 sourc distribut includ in the contrib section 
of x11r5 includ the sourc to the textedit program.  i'd like to take 
the sourc and modifi them to add support for a tooltalk-like messag 
server, and mayb for tooltalk while i'm at it, sinc the sun-suppli
textedit binari doesn't seem to speak tooltalk.

howev, the sourc in the r5 contrib area seem to be for an older
version of textedit than the version ship with openwindow 3.  for
exampl, the own 3.0 textedit includ drag and drop support and a 
dropsit in the main control area, while the sourc in contrib/xview
know noth about drag and drop.

the textedit.c includ in the xview sourc sai it's version 15.50,
date 5/22/90, while do a 'what textedit' on the own 3.0 binari sai:

        textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro
        dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro
        tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro
        ds_relnam.c    1.7 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro

so, doe anyon know if the 9/14/91 sourc to textedit ar avail?
i'd realli like to work from the latest sourc if possibl.

pleas repli by email, and i'll post a summari if there's enough 
interest.
