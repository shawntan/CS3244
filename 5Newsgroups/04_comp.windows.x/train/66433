subject:  58)! where can i get patch to x11r5?

	the releas of new public patch by the mit x consortium is announc
in the comp.window.x.announc newsgroup.

	patch themselv ar avail via ftp from export and from other
site from which x11 is avail. thei ar now also distribut through the 
newsgroup comp.sourc.x. some sourc re-seller mai be includ patch in 
their sourc distribut of x11.

	peopl without ftp access can us the xstuff mail server. it now ha 
23 patch for x11r5 [3/93].  send to xstuff@expo.lc.mit.edu the subject line
		send fix #
where # is the name of the patch and is usual just the number of the patch.

	here ar a few complic:
	1) fix 5 is in four part; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and 
"5d" separ
	2) the file sungx.uu, which wa part of an earlier patch, wa 
re-releas with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with solari]
	3) fix 8 is in two part: "8a" and "8b"

previous wa option
	7) fix 19 also need pexlib.tar.z, which you can obtain from xstuff
by ask for "pexlib.uu.[1234]".
	8) fix 22 is in 9 part, "22a" through "22i"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  59)  what is the xstuff mail-archiv?

	the xstuff server is a mail-respons program. that mean that you mail 
it a request, and it mail back the respons.
	ani of the four possibl command must be the first word on a line. the
xstuff server read your entir messag befor it doe anyth, so you can 
have sever differ command in a singl messag (unless you ask for help). 
the xstuff server treat the "subject:" header line just like ani other line 
of the messag.
	the archiv ar organ into a seri of directori and 
subdirectori.  each directori ha an index, and each subdirectori ha an 
index. the top-level index give you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectori, and the index for each subdirectori tell you what is in it.

	1) the command "help" or "send help" caus the server to send you a 
more detail version of thi help file.
	2) if your messag contain a line whose first word is "index", then 
the server will send you the top-level index of the content of the archiv. if
there ar other word on that line that match the name of subdirectori, then 
the index for those subdirectori ar sent instead of the top-level index. 
for exampl, you can sai "send index fix" (or "index fix"). a messag that 
request an index cannot request data.
	3) if your messag contain a line whose first word is "send", then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) name on the rest of the line. to name 
an item, you give it directori and it name. for exampl
                send fix 1 4 8a 8b 9
	you mai issu multipl send request. the xstuff server contain mani 
safeguard to ensur that it is not monopol by peopl ask for larg 
amount of data. the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fix
amount of data each dai. if the work queue contain more request than the 
dai's quota, then the unsent file will not be process until the next dai. 
whenev the mailer is run to send it dai's quota, it send the request out 
shortest-first.
	4) some mailer produc mail header that ar unus for extract 
return address.  if you us such a mailer, you won't get ani respons.  if 
you happen to know an explicit path, you can includ a line like
        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
        path bar!foo!frotz
in the bodi of your messag, and the daemon will us it.

	the xstuff server itself can be reach at xstuff@expo.lc.mit.edu. if 
your mailer deal in "!" notat, try send to 
{someplac}!mit-eddi!expo.lc.mit.edu!xstuff.
