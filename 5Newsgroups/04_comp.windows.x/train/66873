   ...let me point out that both gui-base word-processor and text-base
   formatt both have a languag; on happen to be mous- and
   action-base, and the other symbol-base.

true, but that's besid the point. thi is a fact about an abstract model
of what the gui user ar do, not about what thei actual *ar* do.
thi abstract model is onli appar from the perpect of a *programm*
of the system. (nb: some user mai see it, too, but onli when thei put
asid the work at hand and start think like a programm.)

i'm not sai that the programm's perspect is evil or stunt. after
all, that's what i do, too! i am sai that ui design must carefulli
distinguish between the user/programm conceptu model, and thei must
ultim serv the user of the system, not the builder of the system. 


   i don't recal the actual stat, but someth like 1 in 5 peopl can be
   categor as a "symbol manipul".

it would be interest to know more about the mean and basi for thi
claim. at ani rate, i don't think thi is evid that 20% of user think
like programm. banker, financi analyst, structur engin ---
these ar all peopl whose work you could character as primarili symbol
manipul. but what thei do is not program, and program is not
requir to do what thei do. 

to restat my previou point: ye, user want to build their own solut;
no, thei do not want to do program to accomplish thi.
