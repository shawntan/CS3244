have run into a problem.  i imagin it ha someth to do with a miss
screen driver, or someth along those line, but figur someon out there
in internet land might be abl to help.

i am instal it on a machin that alreadi ha openlook instal, and would
like to have both instal concurr.  thu, i set it up to compil to my
/usr/x11r5 directori.  i work out all the kink in get it compil (with
gcc), so that it compil without ani warn.  i need it instal for pex-si,
so i set all those appropri flag.  when i run it, howev, i get a messag
along the line of:

get interfac configur : oper not support on socket

sunopenframebuff : inappropri ioctl for devic

fatal server error : no screen found
