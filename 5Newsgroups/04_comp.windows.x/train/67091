i am try to find out if my applic is run on a local or a
remot displai.  a local displai be connect to the same system
that the client is execut on.  i have access to the displai string
but can i tell from the string?

if the client is execut on host foo then ":0", "unix:0", "foo:0",
and "localhost:0" ar all local.  under ultrix, i believ that
"local:0" is also a valid displai name (a share memori connect
mayb?).  ar there other string that i should check for?  is there a
better wai to detect thi?

thank you for ani help you can give me.
