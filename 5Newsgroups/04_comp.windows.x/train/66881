i have the same problem.  i have look at motif++, wwl, interview, gina++,
and a few variat on the abov.  i've also done a cursori examin
of rogu wave's view.h++.  i like view.h++'s abstract best of all of the
toolkit i mention, but the result code look littl like motif, and i
have littl confid that thi softwar will catch on or otherwis result
in signific longev for my code.  gina++ allow you to write code which
look a great deal like motif and also make interest us of inherit,
but the result code is almost too motif-like, and is certainli not
significantli less verbos than equival c code.  interview look
promis, but i haven't found a free version with motif support, and i'm
not confid how wide interview with motif support will be adopt,
and what (if ani) specif motif support will be avail over time.  the
other librari produc code which is less motif-like, but which doe not make
suffici us of the featur of c++ to simplifi my code task.

at thi point, my inclin is to write my motif manipul routin in
c, and invok those routin from my c++ code us simpl abstract suit
to my specif task.  later, if osf or some credibl standard-set bodi
come up with a c++ interfac to motif, i will chang to that.  it doe me
no goo to write in c++ if my choic of interfac leav me with code which
leav me ti to an abstract which is not consist with the industri
direct.  it's better to take a standard if inferior solut for now
than to go with a slgihtli superior approach which will leav me with both
useless code and useless skill a few year from now.  view.h++ is the onli
librari i'd consid right now, but in our environ, we'd end up spend
nearli $5000 to us it, and i can't justifi it when it's like to caus
short-term product decreas as we learn the new abstract, and is
unlik to be a suffici long-live solut for us to reap the benefit
at the high end of the j curv.
