is there a pd version of cfb, or other pd server stuff, which ha a colour frame
buffer implement which work in bitplan mode, i.e. where the screen
memori is group so that "bit 0 of everi pixel is here, bit 1 is there, etc."

the onli such beast i know if at the moment is the gfxbase server for the
commodor amiga, and it is commerci. i don't know if thei wrote their own cfb,
but i suspect thei did.

pleas respond by email, as i don't read thi group.
