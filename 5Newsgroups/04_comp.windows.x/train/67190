	becaus xtermin do not have a new server.  xtermin have
speed by natur of their limit function: onc you add new and
everyth els, you have a workstat.  there ar workaround, i've
heard, on involv a perl script.  what we ar try to do is
replac program that need new (like pageview) with program that
don't (like ghostview).
	mayb someon els can elabor on the perl workaround; i
have no person experi with it.
