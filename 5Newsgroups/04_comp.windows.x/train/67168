sorri, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. thei place the titl at that posit
and the window at a posit below it.

thi becom a problem when you want a program to be abl to save it current
configur and restor is later.

current, my solut is:

	xcreatewindow(...);
	xsetwmproperti(..);
	xmapwindow(...);
	xflush(...);
	xmovewindow(...);


it work with olwm, but is less than eleg. all thi leav me wonder
if i'm overlook someth obviou.

richard.
