window nt is a step forward, but not by much. i guess for do user who
think multi-task is realli _neat_ (add puke here) and ar overjoi to 
be abl to us more than 64k of memori, it a major improv. for window
user it more like an upgrad with facil most unix user take for 
grant. most of  window user onli us pc for text process or run 
3rd-parti applic anywai so the oper system featur ar not even 
a real issu. my ideal oper system:

	binari compat across all plaform. it should recogn
	binari and configur on the fly, so i don't have to have
	bin/mac bin/do bin/dec bin/sun bin/hp etc...

	multi-cpu. so i can us the cpu on my pc and w/s and mac 
	and transput and dsp. i don't know a singl site which 
	ha gone for a singl vendor. i am not go to trade-in 
	80mflop per h1 transput or ultra-fast fft on dsp chip.
	note nt run on symmetr multi-cpu system.

	built-in portabl gui/graphic tool. you can call drawbutton 
	or drawlin and it doe the same thing no matter what platform 
	or displai. it should also translat graphic command on-the-fly.
	so i can us pc graphic s/w on my workstat and x softwar on 
 	my pc. i think gui ar not just nice to have but essenti.

	configur front-end. so you can make it look like unix or do
	or nt or os/2, and run shell script or command/bat file.

	object orient. so i can program easili under it and not have
	to re-invent the wheel if the network is not up to scratch
	or my applic need to access sourc/object code on the fly.

in other word it should have some ai capabl. that and a tight, clean
kernel so you can actual understand it. anyon know of someth like thi ?

	adio
