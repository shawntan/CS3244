alright.  ignor thi.  i have delv a bit deeper (xkeyev) and
found what i wa look for.

ev->state   ha a bunch of mask to check against (lockmask is the on
for capslock).  unfortun, it appear that the numlock mask vari
from server to server.  how doe on tell what mask is numlock and
which ar for meta (mod1mask, mod2mask, mod3mask, mod4mask, mod5mask).
eg, sgi's vendor server ha mod2mask be numlock, wherea solari
1.0.1 openwindow 3.0 ha mod3mask for numlock.  is there an
unambigu mean of determin numlock's mask at runtim for ani
given server?  sorri for the wast bandwidth and my appal ignor.

			thank, ralph
