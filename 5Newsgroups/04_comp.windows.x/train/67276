we develop a toolkit run on the x window system.
the toolkit cope with ani languag base on x11r5's i18n
facil. as you know, there ar 2 kind of i18n implement from mit's 
x11r5 releas -- xsi and ximp. our origin implement of the toolkit
us xsi.

our toolkit manag each charact's size base on our own font manag system.
in order to do that, the 'wchar_t' type charact string must be decompos
to charact set. thi mean that if on wchar_t type compound string with 
ascii and kanji mix, for exampl, is given, each element of the wchar_t
arrai must be check it correspond charact set base on a bit layout
and applic environ's local. in thi case if the local is 'japanes',
each wchar_t charact will be classifi either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.

we need a function to do thi. the function must check how mani charact
from the top ar the same charact set and what the charact set is.

we could not find ani public x11r5 function to do that and inevit, us
xsi's intern function to construct that function. the follow is the
sourc code of that function 'decomposecharacterset()'.


//i18n.h

// $id: i18n.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima exp iima $

    extern _csid _xmbctidtocsid(xlocal, _csid);
};

			  int *buf_len,		/* in/out */

	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : null;
    }
    els
	*charset = null;
    return statu;
}
----------------

an includ file abov, "xlocaleint.h", is also xsi intern and we copi
the file to the toolkit directori and compil.

a seriou issu occur when we tri to compil a toolkit applic on
our hp machin with it os version of hp-ux9.01.

when we tri to link an applic base on our toolkit,
link error occur sai that the follow function ar miss:
    _xmbctidtocsid (code)
    _xmbfsc (code)
    _xwcdecomposeglyphcharset (code)
    _xfallbackconvert (code)

we had us mit releas version of x11r5 and it xsi implement until
hp-up9.0 and ran applic successfulli. on of the reason to us xsi wa that
becaus hp did not releas hp's x11r5 until the os 9.0 and we had no wai to 
know how hp's r5 would be implement. we had hope xsi's popular and us 
it intern function. 

the hp's linker complain that there ar no xsi intern function implement.
we observ from hp's libx11.a, thei us some ximp implement but we ar
not sure if thei us mit's vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and
therefor, find just counter part function in mit's ximp for xsi doe not
seem to lead us a solut.

my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like
'decomposecharacterset()' list abov. is there ani function to check
charact set of each element of wchar_t type string depend on local?
if it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we
want to us ani intern function in hp's x11r5 as we did for mit's r5.

in order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machineri
to judg charact set and that is how the proper font ar select for
the string. we have no wai to find out that without ani hp's x11r5 sourc 
file. we want to know how we can us that for our goal. 
ani help or comment would be highli appreci.

i also appreci if anyon tell me about ximp treat around thi area
even if it is not hp's implement.

thank you.
