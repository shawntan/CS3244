organ: vpi&su comput scienc depart, blacksburg, va
line: 55


   environ:
      mach/arch : sparc/sun4  (ipx)
      os	: suno 4.1.3
      x11	: x11r5 (patchlevel 22)
      motif	: 1.2.2

i bring up x server us 'startx' and /usr/bin/x11/xsun. the follow sequenc
of action crash the x server (sigpip, errno=32, 'xinit' report that connexion 
to x server lost):

   1. xinit -- xsun
   2. start mwm
   3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.
   4. move the window by drag the titl bar.

the server dump core due to sigpip. on of the two messag is print:

  "connect to x server lost"

or
  
  "connect broken (errno=32)"

(i believ the first is report by a client and the second by the server itself).

next, i ran xdm in debug level = 5. after the same set of action, xdm report:

  select return -1
  server for :0 termin unexpectedli: statu 2560


note:
 * the problem doesn't occur with other window manag (twm or olwm). 
 * i have not set ld_librari_path. 
 * i am not run font server. 
 * if i start the client with fix width font, i do not see thi problem.
 * my font path:
     /usr/lib/x11/font/misc/,/usr/lib/x11/font/speedo/,/usr/lib/x11/font/75dpi/,/usr/lib/x11/font/100dpi

   (i did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/x11/font/100dpi, /usr/lib/x11/font/75dpi,
   /usr/lib/x11/font/pex, /usr/lib/x11/font/speedo,
   and in /usr/lib/x11/font/misc).

 * thi problem seem to occur onli on ipx machin. i do not see thi 
   problem on ipc workstat.

question:
 * what the hell is goin on ? :-)
 * what doe "statu 2560" mean (of the server).

i'd greatli appreci ani hint as to the caus of the problem.
