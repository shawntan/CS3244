i agre that thi is a side track, but it is funni that i skip so mani

my belief, opinion, and express ar strictli my own and do not

but.  i have heard that ford motor compani ha (had) a recruit bia
toward engin and awai from comput scienc graduat.  the reason
is supposedli to better meet long rang personnel requir.  thi is
evidenc by the larg number of cs peopl who ar emploi via contract
and ar not brought on board except in special circumst.  thi is
a gener which obvious doesn't alwai hold true, but there ar
statist.  furthermor, most "softwar engin" at ford get done
by electr engin.  i know of 2 univer that have merg the
comput scienc depart and the electr engin so that you
can get a comput degre which qualifi you for much more than program.

but sinc my belief and opinion ar mere figment of my distort
imagin i suppos i should keep it to myself.
