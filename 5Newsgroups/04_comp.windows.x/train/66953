as appli to server, the first three ar fuzzi term.  "multi-head"
tend to be us for ani system with multipl monitor, sometim even
multipl screen even if thei're multiplex onto the same monitor (eg,
a sun with a cg4 displai).  "multi-screen" and "multi-displai" would,
if taken strictli, mean differ thing, but sinc the strict mean
of "multi-displai" would refer to a system with multipl keyboard and
pointer, when it's us it probabl refer to the same thing
"multi-screen" would: a system that provid multipl screen.

"zaphod" is a term appli to the wai the mit server switch the
pointer from on screen to anoth by slide it off the side of the
screen.

there is a protocol limit that restrict a given displai to at
most 255 screen.  i know of no server that handl multipl displai
on a singl invoc, unless possibl my kludg to the r4 server can
be look upon as such; on a tcp-base system there is necessarili a
limit of 65535 displai per machin, but thi is not a limit
inher to x.

what you read wa most like talk about a limit in some particular
implement (probabl the mit on).  if it claim there wa a limit
of 12 inher to x, the author of the articl had no busi write
about x.
