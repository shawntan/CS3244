i wa plan to us the follow pipe to move some displai data to a system
that ha a color hardcopi unit:

	xwd | xwud -displai hostnam:0.0

i had test it with some simpl window like the openwindow file manag,
and it work fine, but when i tri it with a more complex (larger) imag,
the xwd part blew up with a segment fault.  i tri it without the pipe,
by redirect xwd's output to a file and then us the file as input to xwud
and got the same error from xwud.  if i had to guess, it seem like it's
run out of memori, but thi happen on a sparc 10 with 64 meg, 128 meg
swap space, and onli on user with minim activ.  the file wa about 3 mb.

thi verion of xwd/xwud wa suppli with the sun openwindow 3.0 distribut
which i believ correspond to x11 r4.

ani idea?  thank in advanc.
