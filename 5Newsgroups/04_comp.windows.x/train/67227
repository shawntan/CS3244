i am in need of a motif-base graph packag to integr into a larg
softwar packag under develop for distribut to univers.  it
can be either public domain or commerci, although a commerci packag
can't have royalti requir for binari onli distribut.  we need 2-d
graph capabl at a minimum, but 3-d  would be nice.  ani info would
be appreci and i will summar if there is interest.

thank,
mitch
