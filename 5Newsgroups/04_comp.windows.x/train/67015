is there ayth avail for x similar to quickei for the macintosh --
someth that will allow me to store and playback sequenc of keystrok,
menu select, and mous action - direct them toward anoth
applic?

if so, could someon send me inform on it avail -- and if not,
how hard do we think it might be to send input to other x applic and,
hopefulli, deal with their respons appropri?  (if an applic is
go to take a few second to process i probabl have to wait  for it to
complet befor send anoth command.)

thank,

david,
