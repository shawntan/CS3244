if your expos event handler is truli intellig about expos
rectangl inform, then you can us xcleararea to gener an
expos event (assum that your background pixel is not none) for the
enclos rectangl of your new item.

thi is still not great, sinc ani other item contain within that
rectangl will still be unnecessarili redrawn.

if your expos event handler simpli redraw everyth, you'll be
do much more work than just draw the new item "on top" of the
exist scene.
