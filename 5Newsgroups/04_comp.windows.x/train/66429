subject:  16)  what is "low-bandwidth x" (lbx)? xremot? ppp? slip? cslip?

there ar sever option for us x over serial line:

slip - serial line ip; thi is both a mechan and a protocol for send ip
packet over point-to-point serial link. it ha been around for sever year,
and implement ar avail for mani of the major tcp/ip implement.
most x termin vendor suppli thi as a checkoff item, although nobodi realli 
ever us it sinc it is horribl slow.  the tcp/ip header add 40 byte per 
packet and the tcp/ip encod of the x protocol is rather verbos (rightfulli 
so; it is optim for pack and unpack over high-speed link). 

cslip - compress header slip; thi is a variant of slip that compress the 
40 byte of tcp/ip header down to about 5 or 6 byte.  it still doesn't do 
anyth about reencod the x protocol.  modem that do compress can help,
but thei increas packet latenc (it take time to dribbl the uncompress 
data through typic serial interfac, plu the compress assembl time).

ppp - point-to-point protocol; thi is an emerg standard for point-to-point
link over serial line that ha a more complet set of option negoti than
slip.  a grow number of peopl see the combin of ppp for the serial 
line manag and cslip for the header compress as becom common for 
run normal tcp/ip protocol over serial line.  run raw x over the wire
still need compress somewher to make it usabl.

xremot - thi is the name of both a protocol and set of product origin
develop by ncd for squeez the x protocol over serial line.  in addit 
to us a low level transport mechan similar to ppp/cslip, xremot remov 
redund in the x protocol by send delta against previou packet and 
us lzw to compress the entir data stream.  thi work is done by either a 
pseudo-x server or "proxi" run on the host or in a termin server.  there 
ar sever advantag to do compress outsid the modem:
   (1)	you don't *have* to have compress modem in there if you wouldn't 
	otherwis be us them (e.g. if you were go to be directli 
	connect), and
   (2)	it reduc the i/o overhead by cut down on the number of byte that
	have to cross the serial interfac, and
   (3)	in addit to the effect of #2, it reduc the latenc in deliv 
	packet by not requir the modem to buffer up the data wait for 
	block to compress.

lbx - low bandwidth x; thi is an x consortium project that is work on a
standard for thi area.  it is be chair by ncd and xerox and is us 
ncd's xremot protocol as a step stone in develop the new protocol.  lbx
will go beyond xremot by ad proxi cach of commonli-us inform 
(e.g. connect setup data, larg window properti, font metric, keymap, 
etc.) and a more effici encod of the x protocol. the hope is to have a 
standard readi for public review in the first half of next year and a sampl 
implement avail in r6.

addit technic inform about how xremot work and a few note on how
lbx might be differ ar avail via anonym ftp from export.lc.mit.edu

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  18)! what ar all these differ window manag?

	the window manag in x is just anoth client -- it is not part of the
x window system, although it enjoi special privileg -- and so there is
no singl window manag; instead, there ar mani which support differ wai 
for the user to interact with window and differ style of window layout,
decor, and keyboard and colormap focu. in approxim chronolog order
(gener, the more recent on ar more conform with the icccm):

	wm: thi simpl titl-bar window manag wa phase out in r2 or r3
	uwm: the univers window manag is still popular for it speed, 
although it is veri outdat. move to contrib/ on the r4 tape.
	twm (old): tom's window manag wa among the first non-mit window 
manag and offer the user a great deal of custom option in a
re-parent window manag. 
	awm: the ardent window manag remain a hotb for hacker and offer
some featur (dynam menu) not found on more current window manag
	cwm: cwm is part of the andrew system. 
	rtl: siemen's window manag tile window so that thei don't overlap
and resiz the window with the focu to it prefer size.
	dxwm: digit's dxwm is part of the decwindow offer
	hpwm: hp's window manag offer a 3d look; it is a precursor of mwm
	mwm: the motif window manag is part of the osf/motif toolkit
	tekwm: tektronix's window manag offer 
	olwm (sun): olwm implement the open look gui and some of the style
guid function
	olwm (at&t): ditto
	gwm: bull's gener window manag emul other with a built-in
lisp interpret. version 1.7h (10/91) is on the r5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on
avahi.inria.fr and export.lc.mit.edu. [3/93]
	m_swm: the sigma window manag is on the r4 tape
	pswm: sun's postscript-base pswm is part of the openwindow releas
	swm: solbourn's swm is base on the oi toolkit and offer multipl
gui support and also a pan virtual window; configur inform come

	twm (new): mit's new tab window manag from the r4 tape is a rework
twm and is the basi for sever deriv, includ the on on the r5 tape
	vtwm: vtwm offer some of the virtual-desktop featur of swm, with a
singl-root window implement; it is base on the r4 twm and is avail
on archiv server. a new version, vtwm-5.0, is base on r5.9 and is avail 
from export. [3/92]
	tvtwm: tom's virtual tab window manag is also base on the r4 twm
and provid a virtual desktop model on the virtual-root window of swm. it is

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  19)  why doe my x session exit when i kill my window manag (sic)?

	it needn't.  what is probabl happen is that you ar run your 
window manag as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your x 
session run onli as long as the last job is run, and so kill your 
window manag is equival to log out. instead, run the window manag in
the background, and as the last job instead invok someth safe like:
		exec xterm -name login -rv -icon
or ani special client of your devis which exit on some user action.
your x session will continu until you explicitli logout of thi window, 
whether or not you kill or restart your window manag.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  20)  can i save the state of my x session, like toolplac doe?

	although no known window manag directli support such a featur --
which mai be equival to write out a .xinitrc or .xsession file name the
geometri and wm_command of each applic (but olvwm mai have someth 
close) -- there is a contribut applic which doe much of what you ar 
look for, although it is not as complet as the sunview program toolplac. 
look for the applic "xplace" on an archiv-server near you. there ar 
sever version of thi program float around; look for a recent vintag.
[10/90]
	some new pseudo session-manag such as hp's vuewm provid for the 
save of session includ inform on the geometri of current-run
applic and the resourc databas. 
[bjxrn stabel (bjoern@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  21)  how do i us anoth window manag with dec's session manag?

	dec's session manag will start dxwm up by default. to overrid thi, 
add to your .xdefault file someth like thi line, name the full pathnam:
	sm.windowmanagernam:   /wherev/usr/bin/x11/your_favorit_wm

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  22)  how do i chang the keyboard auto-repeat rate?

	you can turn auto-repeat on or off by us "xset r on|off". the x
protocol, howev, doesn't provid for vari the auto-repeat rate, which is
a capabl not support by all system.
	some server run on system that support thi, howev, mai provid
command-line flag to set the rate at start-up time. if you have control over 
server start-up (see the man page for xinit and xdm), you can invok the 
server with the chosen set; for exampl, you can start the xsun server 
from mit with the option "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduc the sensit of the 
keyboard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
subject:  23)  how do i remap the kei on my keyboard to produc a string?

	there is no method of arrang for a particular string to be
produc when you press a particular kei. the xmodmap client, which is us 
for move your ctrl and esc kei to us place, just rearrang kei and 
doe not do "macro expans."
	some (few) client, includ xterm and sever x-base editor, 
accept a translat resourc such as:
	xterm*vt100.translat: #overrid \
		<kei>f1: string("setenv displai unix:0")
which permit the shorthand f1 to be press to reset the displai local
within an xterm; it take effect for new xterm client. to includ control
charact in the string, us \nnn, where nnn is the octal encod of the
control charact you want to includ.
	window manag, which could provid thi facil, do not yet; nor
