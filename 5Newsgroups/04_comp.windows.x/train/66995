if you're will to do a littl work, you can make drawnbutton do what you
want, more-or-less. on of my colleagu here at ge crd ha done just that
in our intern lymb system.

we have a matrix transform class that make it easi to comput a seri of
dial posit from a singl set of vector. each set of vector is then
drawn into a pixmap. click the button advanc the knob's state and
chang to the next pixmap in the sequenc.

us drawnbutton obvious still constrain you to take up a rectangular
portion of the parent widget, but that's normal not a big shortcom. you
can make thing look circular enough.
