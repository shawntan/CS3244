can anyon give me some inform, pleas ...

i need (probabl) to write on or more new motif widget on the hp-ux
platform. do i need the motif privat header file and sourc,
or can i make do with the public header that ar provid?
"motif" includ xt in thi context.

on widget is a multi-column list (which lot of peopl have
alreadi written, i am sure), and would therefor be probabl be
a subclass of list rather than someth simpl like an xt class.
is thi more difficult (in principl, not line of code)?

altern, if anyon ha a multi-column list widget thei
could sell me, thi might save me from have to write on!
doe it by ani chanc exist in motif 1.2 alreadi (i do not
yet have the spec)?

answer appreci,

nichola.
