you ar right in suppos that the problem is with the xmncolormap
(xtncolormap for truli liter be) not be set.  what you want
to do is start your applic with your new colormap.  thi can be a
chicken and egg sort of problem, howev.  if you look at the xt faq
there is an exampl that should show how it can be done.  if not, let
me know and mayb i can improv the exampl.
