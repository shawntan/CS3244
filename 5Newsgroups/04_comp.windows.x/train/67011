hi netter,

i'm us slider in my xview app, usual with edit numer
field. but i seem to have no control over the length of thi field.
in some app it appear long enough to keep sever charact,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum valu set by 
panel_max_valu! 

as i understand, panel_valu_displai_length, which control
number of charact to be displai in text item, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despit the fact that <panel.h>
contain the follow bit:

	/* panel_multilin_text_item, panel_numer_text_item,
	 * panel_slider_item and panel_text_item attribut
	 */
	panel_notifi_level	= panel_attr(attr_enum,			 152),
	panel_valu_displai_length	= panel_attr(attr_int,		 182),

which give a hint that thi attribut can be us for slider.
but 1) set thi attribut give noth, and 2) xv_get'ting
thi attribut give warn: bad attribut, and return valu 0.

can someon share hi experi in manag slider in xview with me,
and clear thi problem?

ani help is veri much appreci.
