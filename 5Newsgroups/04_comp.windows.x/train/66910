i have a peculiar color problem with macx, appl's macintosh x server.
i'd like to know if other have seen the same problem. it's happen
with the current version (1.2), and with version 1.1.7.
when some type of client window ar displai, part of the window
ar in the wrong color; if the window is move slightli, forc the server
to repaint it, it is repaint in the correct color. it doesn't happen
for xterm window, but ha happen for graphic window and with some
motif client.
