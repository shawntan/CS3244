i've been us the xmgraph widget that's been float around and i
notic the perform is significantli better us gadget, perhap
even 100% faster.  i had heard in an old program cours that gadget
were no longer ani benefit to perform, and that it's just as well
to us widget everywher.  so why would ~50 pushbutton gadget be a lot
quicker than 50 pushbutton in the graph?  should i start put gadget
back into my long pulldown menu? 

xmgraph manag children connect by xmarc widget in a direct network
type graph with automat layout capabl.
