depend on the natur of the "round."  x allow the user to do bit
arithmet on pixel valu, (i.e.,  xor foreground and backgroun pixel
valu togeth to calcul a foreground color that when us with a
function of gxxor fill chang foreground to background and vice-versa).
if your round doe not preserv these type of calcul then 
client that us them will break.
