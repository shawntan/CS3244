there is no event mask for a particular mous button press. howev in your
event handler you can us the event structur pass in and queri it to find
which button wa press i.e.

void
someeventhandl(widget w, xtpointer data, xevent *event)
{
    /* catch the button 1 (usual left button) */
    if ( event->xbutton.button == button1 ) {
        /* do some action */
    } els {
        /* do noth and exit from function */
    } 
}
