i post thi a while ago and didn't reciev on repli, and now we
have anoth bug report on the same subject. can anybodi help me out?

how can you ensur that acceler work the same independ of
case?  what i want is ctrl+o and ctrl+o to both be acceler on on
menu entri.

in ora vol. 6, in the section on acceler it sai "for inform
on how to specifi translat tabl see vol. 4...", thi is so you
know what to put for the xmnacceler resourc.  if you go to
vol. 4 it sai, "likewis, if a modifi is specifi, there is
noth to prohibit other modifi from be present as well. for
exampl, the translat:

	shift<kei>q:	quit()

will take effect even if the ctrl kei is held down at the same time as
the shift kei (and the q kei).

thi impli to me that set xmnacceler to ctrl<kei>o should do
what i want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user press the
control kei, the shift kei, and the o kei.

is it possibl to suppli > 1 acceler for a menu entri? keep in
mind when answer thi question that when us motif you can't us
xtinstallacceler().

i am us motif 1.1.3 on a decstat 5000 but i have also tri it
on an hp us motif 1.1.3 and 1.2.
