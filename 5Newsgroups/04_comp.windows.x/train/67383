we have a sun 3/80 and we have just acquir a cg8 frame buffer card.

the cg8 is suppos to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrom visual.
the default visual for the xnew server is the monochrom, and we ar unabl to chang it to
the 24-bit visual. we have tri us xgetvisualinfo to get a visual of depth 24, but had no
success.  xdpyinfo give no inform about a 24-bit deep visual, onli monochrom. 

there ar two possibl solut:
	if someon ha patch for x11r5 xsun server, could thei forward them to us?

	otherwis, could someon instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindow?
