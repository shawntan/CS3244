hello,

i am test a port of x11r5 to coher, a unix clone os for intel architectur
machin.  i am see a strang problem with text in client like xvt (a simpl
termin emul program).

the problem manifest it self when the shell echo type charact back to the
server for displai, on at a time.  the charact appear to be too close
space, with the result be that the 2nd charact echo destroi the 
rightmost edg of the first charact, then the 3rd charact destroi the 
rightmost edg of the second charact, and so on.  it look like there is an
invis boundari around a charact which obscur a portion of the previou
charact.  there is no problem between the charact when the shell return
a complet line of text... onli when the output is a seri of individu
charact.

if anyon ha ani idea what the problem might be, or where i should look to
find it, it would be much appreci.

regard and thank, jon dhuse.
