you could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  clear the
bitmap, draw the rectangl to be delet with gxor.  draw the on
that is to stai with gxclear.  then gxxor the entir pixmap with
the screen.  

note that thi is a pretti effect wai of anim, if you ever
need to do that (replac the gxclear with a gxxor).
