code delet...

>from the xmtextfield man page (dure discuss of resourc):

   xmnverifybel

      specifi whether a bell will sound when an action is revers
      dure a verif callback.

you ar set doit to fals in the callback, and text[field] is beep
as it should.  to turn off thi behavior, set thi boolean resourc to fals.
