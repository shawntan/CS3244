i've been hear rumbl about fresco, and it sound like it mai be
what i'm look for, but how far is it from releas, or at least some kind
of avail?  how similar is it to interview?  if i code to interview,
will my code work with fresco?  how about motif?  i've heard some mention
of version of interview which support motif.  will it be feasibl to us
motif with fresco?
