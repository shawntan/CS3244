make sure you're us "ssetroot", which come with tvtwm.  when tvtwm
start up, it nuke the exist root window.  us an "ssetroot" after
tvtwm start up.   (you could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&")
you can also us "virtualdesktopbackgroundpixmap filenam" or just
virtualdesktopbackground if you just want anoth color besid grei.

did you instal the sunkbd patch?  it's in the contrib directori on export.
all the kei on my keyboard send event properli, except the follow:
the end, pageup, pagedown on the 6-kei cluster aren't recogn.
even the compos kei work.  (though i can't seem to get the compos
charact in an xterm to get pass.)

anyon have a fix for the last two?
