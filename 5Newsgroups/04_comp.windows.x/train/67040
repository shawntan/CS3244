i found an odditi with our sgi indigo (mip r3000 chip).
when xlock +nolock is run, and i am work remot
or in batch (at) mode, the runtim of my program (as time
by us clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if
xlock is not run.  no other process seem to affect my
runtim, yet thi is veri consist!

ani explan, real or imagin :)

thanx
