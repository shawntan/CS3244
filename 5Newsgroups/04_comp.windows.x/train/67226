you'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the kei for each
modifi. the on with numlock in it map is the modifi
you want. a bit ugli perhap but i think it current the onli
wai to do thi (and it doe have some preced as keysym ar 
us to differenti capslock from shiftlock for the lock
modifi).

i don't know of an accept strategi for handl ambigu
assign either. (ie. what if numlock is map for more then
on modifi). i suppos first found is as good as ani.

x doesn't handl lock modifi that well. 

hope that help,
