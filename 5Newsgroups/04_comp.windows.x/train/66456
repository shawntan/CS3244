xdm doe xgrabserv when it's run in secur mode (so do some
screen-lock).  there's realli no simpl wai to tell thi is the case.

you can take xdm out of secur mode;  probabl not too cool.

you can wrap your call to xopendisplai in some code which solict
a futur sigalrm and longjmp past the xopendisplai from the signal
handler.  an exampl of thi can be seen in the xdm sourc.

note that longjmp out of xopendisplai probabl caus a memori
leak;  ani program function thi wai probabl need to exit() 
regularli.
