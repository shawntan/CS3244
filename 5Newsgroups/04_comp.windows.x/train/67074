  ye, it's possibl... in fact, there's some gl widget code in
/usr/lpp/gl somewher... (it's name glib.c; my ibm's down right now
though, so i can't find the exact locat :)

  warn: thi code feel quit bogu. it doe thing like call
noport() befor winopen(), and then extract an x window id from it
anywai. it work just fine under aix 3.1; i spent last weekend try
to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's
turn into a hard job.

  check out your "info" page; it ha some pretti good document on
whan you can and can't do when mix gl and x, and how to go about
do so.
