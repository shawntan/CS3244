i find thi thread on motif acceler absoultli amaz.  if i were
write an interfac to keyboard acceler, i would have on
resourc call "acceler" that took a translat tabl, period.
i would also implement it so that programm never ha to do ani work
to get the acceler instal.  as soon as the end-user specifi
on, it would be activ and automat instal.

to get multipl acceler on a singl menu item i'd do someth like:

	*menuitem.acceler: #overrid \n\
		ctrl<kei>m:	fire() \n\
		shift<kei>l:	fire() \n

the acceler would work exactli like translat and you would
automat see a "ctrl m" show up in your menuitem object.

why in the world is the motif stuff so complic with so mani differ
special case depend on what type of widget you're deal with?  there
ha to be some reason.

sorri for the polit tone of thi messag...
