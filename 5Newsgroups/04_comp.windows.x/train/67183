  there's document on how to us the share memori extens in the
x11r5 distribut.

  actual, i just finish write a motif anim program...
(take-lot-of-imag-data-and-displai-it-pretti-darn-fast). when us
on-server pixmap or share memori, i had to insert a delai loop to keep
it from go too quickli :). test both method side by side, thei
were just about equal.

  the advantag of shm is that your x server doesn't grow to ridicul
size; but pixmap can work over a network and *ar* remov if your
applic di (on tend to us ipcrm manual quit a bit when
debug shm app).

  share memori also ha the problem that some oper system (e.g.
ultrix) seem to allow onli a small number of segment (~6) to be
attach to a process at onc; consequ, a redraw becom
xshmattach();xshmputimag();xshmdetach(); on dec system. and dec's 24
bit displai (like the on i tend to us most often) don't seem to
support the extens (mayb someon compil them wrong?), and us
pixmap caus the x server to crash (fail malloc), so on *ha* to
us the local unix domain socket (which realli isn't that bad; on
copi the info three time per redraw instead of on).

  in short: allow all three form of displai, within the program is a
good thing (minu shm if run over a network), and let the user pick
whatev feel fastest.

  (i just us an ximagehandl class and forget about it :)
