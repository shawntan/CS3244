thi all sound suspici like my compani might have someth to
do with thi.

background first: megatek ha a seri of framebuff design as
x acceler. for the most part these ar design for sun sbu
and sun (and other vendor's) vme system.

that said, megatek product support multi-screen and/or multi-displai
on a sigl workstat. most of our card have a keyboard/mous port
which can be us to provid addit displai. for exampl, sai
you hade a sparcstat with an sbu expans chassi. you could
put in six frambuff, allow a total of six screen in the system.
you could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allow you to
mix and match ani combin of screen and displai. you could
have 1 6-screen displai, 3 2-screen displai, 6 1-screen displai,
or 1 2-screen displai and 1 4-screen displai. basic ani
combin.

becaus of thi, we at megatek try to be veri care about the us
of the word multi-screen and multi-displai. thei ar quit differ
in mean, and (at least in x) have exact definit.

the reason i rambl like thi is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screen in a displai. as it so happen, there's a defin in the server
that determin the most screen support (server/includ/misc.h,
maxscreen). as releas my mit, thi is 3. as releas by megatek,
thi is 12.

as such, the most screen support by a singl megatek displai (i.e.
x server) is 12. if someon constru thi to be a limit of x
i'm sorri, but clearli (as point out so well by mr. neto) thi is
not the case.

we just did it here becaus nobodi ha ever ask us for more. of
cours, i could sai "bui all you want, we'll support more."
