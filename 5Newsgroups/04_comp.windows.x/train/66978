here's what i (think) have figur out.  all i need to do is instal
the r5 disitribut without the xserver like the soni.cf file defin,
and all the new librari, util, etc., will be instal and my old
server from r4 will still work.  thi will allow me to run xview 3.0,
and have x11r5 up and run.  doe the server interfac remain the
same with all chang made onli to the lib?

anoth question: is it like that sinc sun is drop ow support
that the desktop util (like the file manag) will be made public?
it would be nice if compani would make old code public for the
benefit of those of us with smaller budget. :)
