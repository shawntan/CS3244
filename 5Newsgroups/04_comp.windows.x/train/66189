frequent ask question about x on intel-base unix (with answer)
=====================================================================

i) what option do i have for x softwar on my intel-base unix system?

1. free option
	the best option is xfree86, which is an enhanc version of x386 1.2.
	ani other version of x386 will have slower perform, and will
	be more difficult to compil.  inform on how to obtain xfree86
	is list below.

	x386 is the port of the x11 server to system v/386 that wa
	done by thoma roell (roell@sgc.com).
	it support a wide varieti of svga board.
	there ar 2 major free version: x386 1.1 is base on x11r4,
	x386 1.2 is includ in mit's x11r5 distribut (ie. you
	don't need to patch it into the mit sourc ani more).
	x386 1.3 is the current commerci offer from sgc (see below).

ii) what is xfree86 and where do i get it?

3. what is xfree86?

   xfree86 is an enhanc version of x386 1.2, which wa distribut with
   x11r5.  thi releas consist of mani bug fix, speed improv, and
   other enhanc.  here ar the highlight of the enhanc:

    1) the speedup packag from glenn lai is an integr part of xfree86,
       select at run-time via the xconfig file.  some speedup requir
       an et4000 base svga, and other requir a virtual screen width of
       1024.  the speedup suitabl to the configur ar select by
       default.  with a high-qualiti et4000 board (vram), thi can yield
       up to 40% improv of the xstone benchmark over x386 1.2.
    2) the fx386 packag from jim tsilla ar includ as the default
       oper mode if speedup is not select.  thi mode is now
       equival in perform to x386 1.1b (x11r4), and approxim
       20% faster than x386 1.2.
    3) support for localconn, compil-time select for server, client,
       or both.  thi support is for both svr3.2 and svr4.  for svr4.0.4
       with the 'advanc compat packag', local connect from
       sco xsight/odt client ar support.
    4) driver for ati and trident tvga8900c and tvga9000 svga chipset.
       refer to the file readm.ati and readm.trident for detail about
       the ati and trident driver.
    5) support for compress bitmap font ha been ad (thoma eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directori on export.lc.mit.edu).
    6) type1 font code from mit contrib tape ha been includ, and is
       compil-time select.  there ar contribut type1 font in the
       contrib directori on export.lc.mit.edu.
    7) new configur method which allow the server's driver and font
       render to be reconfigur from both sourc and binari
       distribut.
    8) integr support for 386bsd, mach, and linux.
    9) a monochrom version of the server which will run on gener vga
       card is now includ.

   the follow kei featur were ad with the releas of xfree86 1.2
   (thei were not in xfree86 1.1):

    1) the monochrom server ha been enhanc to do bank-switch of
       avail svga memori to allow virtual screen up to 1600x1200 
       (see the x386(1) manual page for more inform).
    2) support for the hercul mono card ha been ad to the
       monochrom server, and with it the abil to support a "two
       head" server - on vga, and on hercul.  so far thi ha onli
       been test on svr4 (it is also report to work under linux).
    3) svr3 share librari, test under isc svr3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
    4) support for svr4.2 (there ar some special consider to
       consid, due to new usl bug; see the readm.svr4 file for
       more inform.)
    5) support for ps/2 mice, and logitech mouseman/trackman (some 
       version of these devic were not previous compat).
    6) a new tutori on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       time data, written by eric raymond (deriv from previou
       document and a lot of experiment).
    7) greatli improv support for intern keyboard, includ
       implement of the compos kei function found on mani 
       vendor server (see the x386keybd(1) manual page for more 
       inform).
    8) the accuraci with which the server detect svga pixel clock ha
       been improv, and the time ar now store at accuraci of
       0.1 mhz.  user mai want to consid remov an exist clock
       line from their xconfig file and re-probe us the new server.
    9) mani enhanc in error handl and pars of the xconfig
       configur file.  error messag ar much more inform
       and intuit, and more valid is done.  there ar mani new
       option that can be enabl in the xconfig file (see the x386(1) 
       manual page for more inform on the format of thi file).

       plu a number of other small thing.  refer to the changelog file
       in the sourc distribut for full detail.

   also includ ar a tutori on monitor time by eric raymond, and the
   current x386 mode databas and a sampl xdm configur by david wexelblat.

4. what oss ar support?

    xfree86 support:
	svr4.2: consensi v4.2
	svr4.0: microport, dell, esix, isc, at&t, mst, consensi, uhc
	svr3: isc 2.2 & 3.0, at&t 2.2
	linux, mach 386, 386bsd 0.1

	bsd/386 is not support, but it should work. the most activ
	bsd/386 person is greg lehei <grog@lemi.de>.

	note that esix 3.2d and sco ar not support yet,
	but anyon should feel free to submit patch.
	if you ar interest in tackl thi, send mail to
	xfree86@physic.su.oz.au

5. what video hardwar is support?

   at thi time, xfree86 1.2 support the follow svga chipset:

	tseng et4000
	tseng et3000
	paradis pvga1
	western digit wd90c00, wd90c10, wd90c11 (these ar superset of
		the pvga1, and us it driver)
	genoa gvga
	trident tvga8900c, tvga9000
	ati 18800, 28800

	all of the abov ar support in both 256 color and monochrom mode,
	with the except of the ati chipset, which ar onli support in
	256 color mode.

	the monochrom server also support gener vga card, us 64k of
	video memori in a singl bank, and the hercul card.  on the
	et3000, onli 64k of video memori is support for the monochrom
	server, and the gvga ha not been test with more than 64k.

	it appear that some of the svga card manufactur ar go to
	non-tradit mechan for select pixel-clock frequenc.  to
	avoid have to modifi the server to accommod these scheme xfree86
	1.2 add support for us an extern program to select the pixel
	clock.  thi allow program to be written as new mechan ar
	discov.  refer to the readm.clkprog file for inform on how
	these program work, if you need to write on.  if you do develop such
	a program, the xfree86 team would be interest in includ it with
	futur xfree86 releas.

	if you ar purchas new hardwar for the purpos of us xfree86,
	it is suggest that you purchas an et4000-base board such as the
	orchid prodesign ii.  avoid recent diamond board; xfree86 will not
	work with them, becaus diamond won't provid program detail.
	in fact, the xfree86 project is activ not support new diamond
	product, as long as such polici remain in effect.  contribut
	of code will not be accept (becaus of the potenti liabil).
	if you would like to see thi chang, tell diamond about it.

	some peopl have ask if xfree86 would work with local bu or eisa
	video card. theoret, the mean of commun between the
	cpu and the video card is irrelev to xfree86 compat. it
	could be isa, eisa, or local bu.  what should matter is the chipset
	on the video card.  unfortun, the develop don't have a lot
	of access to eisa or vlb machin, so thi is larg an untest
	theori.  howev, we have yet to see ani report of thing not
	work on on of these buse and we have sever report of xfree86
	work fine on them.

6. what about acceler board?

	at thi time, there is no support in xfree86 for acceler board
	like the s3, ati ultra (8514/a), tiga, etc.  thi support is avail
	in commerci product from sgc and metrolink (for svr3 and svr4).

	an s3 server is avail for 386bsd and linux.  contact
	<hasti@netcom.com> for 386bsd or <jon@robot.ox.ac.uk> for linux.

	a beta 8514/a server is avail for linux. contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>
	or <jon@robot.ox.ac.uk>. note: these server ar not part of xfree86.

7. why doesn't xfree86 support 16-color vga mode?

	the reason that thi is not support is the wai vga implement the
	16-color mode.  in 256-color mode, each byte of frame buffer memori
	contain 1 pixel.  but the 16-color mode ar implement as bit-
	plane.  each byte of frame- buffer memori contain 1 bit from each
	of each of 8 pixel, and there ar four such plane.  the mit frame-
	buffer code is not design to deal with thi.  if vga handl
	16-color mode by pack 2 4-bit pixel into each byte, the mit code
	could be modifi to support thi (or it alreadi mai; i'm not sure).
	but for the vga wai of do thing, a complet new frame-buffer
	implement is requir.  some beta tester ar look into thi,
	but noth is yet avail from the project.

8. what other hardwar or softwar requir ar there?

	obvious, a support svga board and os ar requir.  to run
	x effici, 12-16mb of memori should be consid a minimum.
	the variou binari releas take 10-40mb of disk space, depend
	on the os (e.g. whether or not it support share librari).
	to build from sourc, at least 80mb of free disk space will
	be requir, although 120mb should be consid a comfort 
	lower bound.

9. where can i get sourc for xfree86?

	sourc patch for the current version (1.2, base on x11r5 pl22
	from mit), ar avail via anonym ftp from:
		export.lc.mit.edu (under /contrib/xfree86)
		ftp.physic.su.oz.au (under /xfree86)
		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/xfree86)
	(for the rest of thi faq, these 3 locat will be call $ftp)

	refer to the readm file under the specifi directori for inform
	on which file you need to get to build your distribut.

10. where can i get binari for xfree86?

	binari ar avail via anonym ftp from:
		ftp.physic.su.oz.au		- svr4 binari
			under /xfree86/svr4
		ftp.win.tue.nl			- svr4 binari
			under /pub/xfree86/svr4
		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- svr4 binari
			under /pub/svr4/xfree86
		stasi.bradlei.edu		- svr4 binari
			under /pub/xfree86/svr4
		blancmang.ma.utexa.edu	- svr3 (isc) binari
			under /pub/isc
		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - svr3 (isc) binari
			under /pub/pc/isc/xfree86
		tsx-11.mit.edu			- linux binari
			under /pub/linux/packag/x11
		agat.berkelei.edu		- 386bsd binari
			under /pub/386bsd/0.1-port/xfree86
		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- mach binari
			under /i386

	ensur that you ar get xfree86 1.2 - some of these site mai
	archiv older releas as well.  each binari distribut will
	contain a readm file that describ what file you need to take
	from the archiv, and which compil-time option select were
	made when build the distribut.

iv) what gener thing should i know about run xfree86?

11. instal directori

	the top-level instal directori is specifi by the projectroot
	(/usr/x386, by default) variabl in config/site.def. binari, includ
	file, and librari ar instal in $projectroot/{bin,includ,lib}.

	thi can be chang when rebuild from sourc, and can be modifi
	via symbol link for those oss that support them. thi directori is
	nonstandard, and wa chosen thi wai to allow xfree86 to be instal
	alongsid a commerci/vendor-suppli x implement.

12. configur file

	the xfree86 server read a configur file ("xconfig") on startup.
	the search path, content and syntax for thi file ar document in
	the server manpag, which should be consult befor ask question.

13. determin vga dot clock and monitor mode

	david e wexelblat (dwex@mtgzf3.att.com) maintain a databas of known
	clock set for vga card and monitor set.
	the databas is instal in /usr/x386/lib/x11/etc/modedb.txt, and
	is in the sourc tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. thi databas is
	also avail from him (for the latest copi), and is kept on
	export.lc.mit.edu in ~/contrib/x386.modedb.z, which is updat
	occasion.  obtain a copi of thi databas.  it just might have the
	set you need.  if you creat new set, pleas send them to
	david for inclus in the databas.

	if thi doesn't help you, the videomod.doc (by eric raymond) file 
	with xfree86 contain tutori on how to come up with these time.
	it mai be help to start with set that almost work, and us
	thi descript to get them right.  when you do, send the inform
	to david wexelblat for inclus in the databas.

	note: the old 'clock.ex' program is not support ani more, and
	      is complet unnecessari.  if you need to determin dot
	      clock valu for a new board, remov the 'clock' line from
	      your xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  the
	      server will probe for clock itself and print them out.
	      you can us these valu to put a 'clock' line into your
	      xconfig file, which is not necessari, but will speed up
	      start the server in the futur.

14. rebuild/reconfigur the server from the link kit

	if you have instal the server binari link kit, it is possibl to
	reconfigur the driver and font render in the server.  thi is
	fulli explain in the readm file that is avail with the link kit.

v) what os-specif thing should i know about run xfree86?

	first of all, the server must be instal suid-root (mode 4755).

15. svr4
	why won't my xterm run properli?

	if your kernel is not built with the consem modul, you should defin
	consem=no in you environ. otherwis xterm won't run.
	csh user should us 'setenv consem no'

	the esix consol driver patch 403019 is known to caus keymap
	problem with xfree86.  it recommend that thi patch not be
	instal.  altern thei keymap can be fix with xmodmap.

16. svr3

	make sure you look at $ftp/readm.isc, if that's what you ar run.

17. 386bsd

	make sure you look at $ftp/readm.386bsd.

	also, a separ 386bsd faq is maintain by richard murphei
	<rich@rice.edu>.  the latest version should be avail in the
	file xfree86-1.2-386bsd-faq at the follow ftp site:

	    agat.berkelei.edu:/pub/386bsd/0.1-port/xfree86-1.2
	    wuarchiv.wustl.edu:/mirror4/386bsd/0.1-port/xfree86-1.2
	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386bsd/0.1-port/xfree86-1.2

18. linux

	you must be run linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc
	jump librari instal.

	make sure the binari x386, x386mono, xload and xterm ar setuid root.

	if your kernel doesn't have tcp support compil in, you'll have to
	run the server as "x -pn". the default startup configur assum
	that tcp is not avail. if it is, chang the two file
	/usr/x386/bin/startx and /usr/x386/lib/x11/xdm/xserver, remov the
	-pn argument to x386.

	make sure /dev/consol is either a link to /dev/tty0 or ha the major
	number 4, minor number 0. also note that if /dev/consol is not
	own by the user run x, then xconsol and xterm will not permit
	consol output redirect. xdm will properli chang the owner, but
	startx won't.

	when run xdm from rc.local, you will need to provid it with
	a tty, for exampl "xdm < /dev/consol &".

	for more detail inform, pleas read the file readm present
	with the distribut on tsx-11.mit.edu.

19. mach

	make sure you look at $ftp/readm.mach.

vi) what thing should i know for build xfree86 from sourc?

	thi section ha been remov from the faq, sinc it is
	fulli explain in $ftp/readm and the os-specif readm.
	pleas look at those file for inform on build xfree86.

vii) is there anyth special about build client with xfree86?

20. bsd compat librari

	a lot of client make us of bsd function like bcopi(), etc.
	the default configur file ar set up to link with libxbsd.a
	which contain emul for bcopi(), bzero(), bcmp(), ff(), random(),
	seed(). a better wai of provid the 'b' function is to includ
	<x11/xfunc.h> in sourc file that call them.  xfunc.h provid macro
	definit for these in term of the sysv 'mem' function.  if you ar
	link with a vendor suppli librari which call some of these
	function, then you should link with libxbsd.a

21. ansiccopt

	thi is someth that wa ad to allow a develop to get rid of the
	ansi-ness defin in the default ccoption without have to rewrit
	the entir ccoption line.  for exampl, with stock mit, you'd see
	someth like
		ccoption="-ansi -o2 -fwritabl-string"
	and to get rid of the ansi-ness, the develop would have to put
		ccoption="-o2 -fwritabl-string"
	in hi imakefil.  with thi chang, you would see a default of
		ansiccopt="-ansi"
		ccoption="-o2 -fwritabl-string"
	and all the develop would have to put in the imakefil is:
		ansiccopt=
	to get rid of the ansi-ness (mani x client will die a horribl death
	with -ansi).  the effect is even more dramat in practic, becaus
	ccoption is actual quit complex.  the other issu is that on must
	add 'ansiccopt=$(ansiccopt)' to a passcdebugflag definit.
