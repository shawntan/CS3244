 o ad new resourc, gethostbynameisevil, for sun's that
   coredump when gethostbynam() is call to try to find out what
   their own name ar. (command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o explicitli pop down all dialog box when document view
   window is close, for window manag too dull to do so
   themselv. 
 o better visit anchor color for non-sgi's. 
 o ad .hqx and .uu to list of file extens handl like .tar file. 
 o ad 'clear' button to open box, to allow more conveni
   cut-n-past entri of url's.
