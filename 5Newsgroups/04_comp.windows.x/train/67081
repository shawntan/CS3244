problem:
	when mous is move across screen horizont, the sprite goe off
	of the edg of the screen and reappear at the *other* edg.
	it appear that the server think we ar run in multi-screen
	mode; the cursor seem to "wrap" from on side of the screen to
	the other.
	as far as we can tell, we ar not run the server in multi-screen
	mode.

pleas repli via e-mail.
