i expect what is go on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new applic start up, it cannot add the color that it need to the colormap.
it therefor ha to pick and choos from the exist color.  thi make it look
ugli until it's window get prioriti.  then macx chang the colormap so that
the select app is get the exact color it want, but now other applic
ar have to make do with it's colormap.

thi is a problem with all color x server (or at least all color xserver i have
seen) when the demand of the applic exce the size of the colormap.
my solut is usual to (1) avoid colormap-greedi app and (2) displai
applic where color is just ic on the cake in monochrom mode rather
than in color (if thi is an option for the applic).
