i am current attempt to get a copi of the hp widget set compil
under linux (sl releas with kernel 99.6) and am run into some
problem.  actual, it seem that thi is more of a gcc question,
becaus i got it to compil without troubl us cc on an rs/6000.
	basic, there ar a number of function with prototyp
set up in, let's sai, compositep.h, for instanc, the composit
widget's insert_child procedur is set up with the type :

	typedef void (*xtwidgetproc) (widget)

but in sever place in the hp sourc code, thei refer the
insert_child procedur and pass it multipl argument instead of just
on, as the prototyp suggest.  for exampl:

	(*superclass->composit_class.insert_child)(w, arg, p_num_arg)

now, gcc choke on thi, give an error messag that too mani argument
ar pass to the function.  so, doe anyon have ani suggest as to
how to turn off thi check in gcc, or how i can go about chang the
code to accomod thi call without chang /usr/includ/x11/compositep.h,
or ha anyon successfulli built the hp widget set and have ani suggest.
	mani thank in advanc for ani help.
