greet.

i am develop an applic that allow a *user* to interact
creat/edit/view a visual "model" (i.e. topolog) of their network, and
i wa wonder if anyon knew of ani builder tool that exist to
simplifi thi task.

in the past i have us visual edg's uim/x product to develop other
gui, so i am familiar with uimss in gener.

the topolog will support object and connect link.  onc the
topolog is creat, i want to provid the user with capabl to
support group, zoom, etc.

i am look for some form of a higher abstract other than x draw
routin to accomplish thi.  specif, the zoom and group
aspect mai prove difficult, and certainli time consum,  if i have
to "roll my own".

suggest?
