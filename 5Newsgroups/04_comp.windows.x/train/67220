   sorri, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. thei place the titl at that posit
   and the window at a posit below it.

   thi becom a problem when you want a program to be abl to save it current
   configur and restor is later.

   current, my solut is:

	   xcreatewindow(...);
	   xsetwmproperti(..);
	   xmapwindow(...);
	   xflush(...);
	   xmovewindow(...);


   it work with olwm, but is less than eleg. all thi leav me wonder
   if i'm overlook someth obviou.

   richard.


i know that the mwm ha an resourc to specifi if posit ar to be us for
the border of a window or for the "user" window. mayb other window manag
have similar option.
anoth wai to figur out the differ between the "user" window posit
and the window manag decor window posit is to subtract their
posit. you just have to us xquerytre and rememb that the window manag
decor window is the parent of your window. unfortun, you can onli
figur out the decor width and height after the window ha been map
thi wai.
