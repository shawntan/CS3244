you've got to set border_pixel in your window attribut. the default
is copyfrompar which give the badmatch. do thi:

   ...
   unsign long valuemask;
   ...
   /*
    * if border_width is non-zero you'd better alloc a colour from cmap
    * rather than us ani old pixel valu. also, us valuemask, it make
    * the code more obviou.
    */
   attr.colormap = cmap;
   attr.border_pixel = 0;
   valuemask = cwcolormap | cwborderpixel;
   win = xcreatewindow(
           dpy,
           defaultrootwindow(dpy),
           10,10,
           width,height,
           0,		         /* border width. see comment below */
           8,                    /* depth */
           inputoutput,          /* class */
           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
           valuemask,
           &attr
         );

a note on border_width: your code look like thi:

>>   win = xcreatewindow(
>>           dpy,
>>           defaultrootwindow(dpy),
>>           10,10,
>>           width,height,
>>           copyfrompar,       /* border width */
>>           8,                    /* depth */
>>           inputoutput,          /* class */
>>           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
>>           cwcolormap,
>>           &attr
>>         );

border_width set to copyfrompar work but doesn't make sens.
border_width should be an unsign int. you get awai with it becaus
copyfrompar is #defin'ed to be zero in x.h. if it happen to be
defin as -1 you'd get a veri interest look window!
