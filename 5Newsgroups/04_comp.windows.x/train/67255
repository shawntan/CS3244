ha anyon found a fix for the follow problem?

client softwar:	suno 4.1.1, x11r5
server hardwar:	sun ipc
server softwar:	suno 4.1.1, open window 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)

a motif 1.2.2 applic will period hang when run against the
openwindow 3.0 server (xnew). the pulldown is displai but then no
button action have ani effect. sometim press <return> will
unstick the applic but not usual. it look like the pulldown is
grab the focu and never let go. other window on the displai
continu to get updat so the server isn't hang. if i log in from
anoth termin and kill the motif applic then everyth get
back to normal. the same applic when run against other x server
(includ mit x11r5 xsun, decwindow, tektronix x termin) ha no
problem. thi is obvious a openwindow problem but i need a
work-around sinc most of our custom ar openwindow user.

i have tri the follow thing:

    1. instal the latest version of the openwindow server patch
       (100444-37).

    2. us mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.

    3. appli the patch specifi in the motif faq (question 110).
       thi had the effect of disabl the point-and-click method of
       menu interact (as oppos to the click-and-drag method), and
       screw up the menu mnemon kei. it did seem to help, but i
       wa still abl to get the applic to hang.

repeat by:

thi is an intermitt problem so you'll have to try sever time.

click and releas on a menu head (pulldown menu will pop up)

click and releas on a menu item

repeat until applic hang


ani help would be appreci. thank in advanc.
