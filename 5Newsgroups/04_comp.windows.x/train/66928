  let me add anoth of my concern: ye, i can bui a port of motif for "cheap",
but i cannot get the sourc for "cheap", henc i am limit to us whatev x
librari the motif port wa compil against (at least with older version of
motif. i have been told that motif 1.2 can be us with ani x, but i have not
seen it myself).

  current, i have x11r5 run on eight differ unix platform, of which
onli three came with motif. on those three, i am unabl to us the x11r5
librari to build motif client, becaus i get link error between the
vendor-suppli port of motif and my x11r5. i anticip have thi same
problem when x11r6 becom avail.

  the result is that i cannot build motif client that reli on x11r5, sinc i do
not have motif compil under x11r5. true, i could bui anoth port of motif,
but that sort of ruin the whole idea of "free", doesn't it?

    cheer,
