i just had an idea. i'm not sure if it been done and i'm just
rememb it unconsi, but i thought that in dialog
box and whatev in window system, there should be a
wai to intuitivli set some thing check or uncheck or
fill in a certain wai. my idea: tape. you know, like put
a piec of tape over a light switch?
just an idea, if you like it, us it.
