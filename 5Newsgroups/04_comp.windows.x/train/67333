even 24bit truecolor machin ar in most case run an emul
8 bit pseudocolor visual, onli to get standard x client, motif app and
thelik to run. i strongli suppos you to emul at least:

> 24 bit truecolor. should be no problem, onli some translat. round
  should not make big misfit
> 8 bit pseudocolor. more of a problem, you have to emul a colormap,
  pixel indic, convers stuff. furthermor, you should run your default
  screen on thi visual.
