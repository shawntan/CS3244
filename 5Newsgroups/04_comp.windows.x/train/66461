well i am not sure if thi is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anywai.
i am run xterm and like all unix user, i run man <someth>. recent,
i switch to solari 2.1, and their man page ar litter with ".i" direct
that ar somehow translat into revers video when displai by man under xterm.
the result output (admittedli a person tast) is veri annoi to look at.
back when i wa us suno 4.1.2, i rememb their man page have some keyword
displai with underlin....

so my question is how do i chang the xterm's behaviour under ".i" direct 
for nroff man page, to perhap underlin, or at least disabl it. (".b" 
direct ar fine, i like them. and of cours, i don't want to go in and edit
the man page input...) somehow, xterm allow on to specifi both a normal font
and a bold font, but not an ital font??

ani pointer, suggest ar greatli appreci.
thank -- john

p.s. run xterm -rv won't work, i tri...
