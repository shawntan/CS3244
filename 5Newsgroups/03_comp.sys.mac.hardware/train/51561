it clearli depend on the type of question you ar ask but in mani
case it will do fine. the critic inform from the neuron is in
the fire frequenc (maximum about 100 action potenti per
second), and not in the amplitud of the signal or in detail of the
signal shape. so the resolut of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit
convertor is more then suffici.

ac coupl doe not have to be a problem either, sinc in mani case
you ar not interest in the dc level. my pre amplifi is ac coupl
also. the critic point is the lowest frequenc that will pass. if
the cutoff point is to high, the action potenti will be slightli
distort. but even that normal doe not matter sinc it is the
occurr of the spike that is import. 

howev, i do want to know what exactli i can expect befor i start
battl with the toolbox to get it go. as yet i have no clue were
to start look for the technic specif.
