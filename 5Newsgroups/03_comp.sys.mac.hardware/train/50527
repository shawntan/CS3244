well folk, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:

"why would appl releas a duo dock with a processor of it own?"

here's why- peopl have hound appl for a notebook with a 68040 processor
in it. appl can't deliv that right now becaus the 040 sap too much
power, radiat far too much heat, and is too larg for a notebook. how
doe on get around that without design a new chipset? us exist
powerbook technolog to your best advantag. the duo dock give appl a
uniqu abil to give user that 040 power in a "semi-portabl" fashion.
by plunk the 040 into the dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk.
on the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be abl to handl most of your need.
okai, not the best solut, but it an answer to a no-win situat. :-)
so, doe thi mean on will be abl to us the powerbook's processor in
parallel to the dock's processor? okai, we're get realli hypothet
now...
