but the interest comparis is how fast clock-cycl chip
you can get - an alpha is wai slow at 66 mhz, but blaze at
200 mhz.

but the 68040 is (or will soon be) avail in 40 mhz version,
make it "compar" to a 486dx2-80

i think you have that on turn around; thei have faster clock
cycl but less power behind each cycl. not to mention that the
intel instruct stream is byte-orient (longest intel instruct
is 15 byte; what an odd number :-) which make it hard to do ani
intellig memori subsystem.
