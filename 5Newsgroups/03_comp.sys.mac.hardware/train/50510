i recent aquir a quantum q250 harddisk. it is a 50 meg 5.25"
mechan. it is scsi. i have a few question and a few problem. first
there seem to be an extra connector socket on the back that i can't
figur out what it is for. the address is set by some jumper on the
bottom so i don't think it is for that. ani idea?

second, it would be nice to get a hardwar manual for the drive. there ar
a lot of jumper on it that we don't know what thei ar for.

third, i have got the drive to format. it took a while to get thing to
work and most of it is fine for now. the format initiali wa
troublesom but seem to be ok. the main problem is if you do a reset on
the macplu the drive disappear. if i shut the mac off and then back on
agian then the drive come up fine. ani idea.

pleas repli to on of the email address below.

thank
