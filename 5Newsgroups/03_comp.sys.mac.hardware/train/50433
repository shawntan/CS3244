	i had ask everyon about problem instal a 4 meg
simm and an 8 meg simm in my centri 610, but the folk at the
local appl store call the folk in cupertino and found that
you can't have simm of differ speed in on machin, even
if thei ar both fast enough - ie - my 80 ns 8 meg and 60ns 4
meg simm were incompatib...  just thought peopl might
want to know.....
