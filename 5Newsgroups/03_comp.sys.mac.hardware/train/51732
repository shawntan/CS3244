anyon out there have a soni 1304s?

i have on, and it's veri nice, howev - if i run it in 16" mode, the
pictur won't
go veri big. i end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top &
bottom. i suspect
an intern adjust would fix thi. anyon tri it?

anoth problem is sub-bright: area that ar meant to be black (or
off the main
raster) ar not veri black. the real raster is quit visibl when the
screen is blank.
thi is not too sever, but it is just not as good as other trini screen
i have
us. if i turn the bright/contrast down so that the raster is not
visibl, the
real imag virtual disappear!

the raster size is just right if i us 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too
much!

oh, and i am us a rasterop 24xli card.


thank
