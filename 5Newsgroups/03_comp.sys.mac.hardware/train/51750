ye, quit a number of peopl it seem from discuss i've had (me
includ). i bought my machin a coupl of week ago as well and
start to experi these problem.

appl australia via my dealer said that thi problem ha a number of
potenti caus - faulti applic, faulti third parti hardwar
(modem, memori etc), system softwar, pram corrupt and power
manag corrupt, and the duo hardwar itself.

none of the abov ar relev in my case except the last two mayb
(no applic were run, the system softwar wa re-instal, i
have no addit hardwar). i have found that clear pram appear
to help for a while at least (hold down command option p and r on
startup). unfortun the problem return suggest that pram is
be corrupt by someth (system softwar bug ? - i don't have ani
non-issu init in my system). appar the power manag can be
reset by "hold the reset and interrupt button while power up" -
appl's advic - but sinc the duo doe not have an interrupt button
i'm not sure what thei mean in thi case. thi mai also help if
someon can deciph appl's advic for me.

beyond thi appl suggest that " you should follow the technic
procedur to check the hardwar of thi duo". sinc so mani other
appear to be have the same problem it would seem to me that there
ha been a system softwar bug introduc somewher along the line -
and quit recent too - sinc it onli seem to be recent duo 230
purchas who have thi problem.

ani more comment from other in the same boat ar welcom,
particularli appl duo engin :-)

cheer
