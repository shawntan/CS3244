i am resend thi messag becaus my new program mai have goof the first
time.

terri, i recent bought an lciii and a datadesk 101e. i don't
rememb try to rebuild the desktop with it, howev it did give me
a strang problem.  when i held down shift dure startup to disabl
all extens, noth happen. i tri it with anoth keyboard, us
the same adb connector cabl- and it work with the other keyboard.
the shift kei on the datadesk keyboard work well otherwis. i check
the dipswitch and thei ar fine.  try disabl your extens and tell
me if it work.
             
i am annoi with datadesk.  i sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspect/repair/replac.  the technician on the phone said thei
have a 10-14 dai turn around time- mean you should receiv the
inspect/repair keyboard in that time.  well, thei have had the          
keyboard for over 3 week and i still have gotten veri littl info
from them about it. it's annoi becaus it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard and their technic support line is not toll free. tell me
if you have a similar experi with them.
