i don't know how mani time i've post thi the net.  no on ever
listen.  

onc and for all:  floptic media is onli $1.40 a megabyt if you don't
know where to bui it.  i am by my floptic at $30 per 2 disk.  i
see that as $.75 a meagabyt, not $1.40.  no, i'm not bui in bulk, i'm
not get a special deal.  $.75 a meg is good in my book, approch
floppi price.

ani question on my sourc can be sent to ctr@po.cwru.edu.
