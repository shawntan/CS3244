can anyon tell me what the differ is between a 256k dram chip and a
256k simm? i need the former (i think) to add memori to my laserwrit
ls. someon is offer to sell me 256k simm he remov from an se, but
i have a feel thi mai not be the correct form of memori. the socket
in the laserwrit look like thei want the spideri-shape chip (there
ar 4 socket, each with, as i recal, 20 pin, arrang in two row of 10). believ it or not, i've never actual seen a simm. help appreci.
