i've had the board for over a year, and it doe work with diskdoubl,
but not with autodoubl, due to a licens problem with stac technolog,
the owner of the board's compress technolog. (i'm write thi
from memori; i've lost the refer. pleas correct me if i'm wrong.)

us the board, i've had problem with file icon be lost, but it's
hard to sai whether it's the board's fault or someth els; howev,
if i decompress the troubl file and recompress it without the board,
the icon usual reappear. becaus of the abov mention licens
problem, the freewar expans util dd expand will not decompress
a board-compress file unless you have the board instal.

sinc stac ha it own product now, it seem unlik that the hole
in autodoubl/diskdoubl relat to the board will be fix.
which is sad, and make me veri reluct to bui stac's product sinc
thei're be so stinki. (but hei, that's competit.)
