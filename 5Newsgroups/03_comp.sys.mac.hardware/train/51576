subject: help!!  my macintosh "luggabl" ha line on it screen!
organ: occident colleg, lo angel, ca 90041 usa.
distribut: comp
line: 20

okai, i don't us it veri much, but i would like for it to keep work
correctli, at least as long as appl continu to make system softwar
that will run on it, if slowli :-)

here is the problem:  when the screen is tilt too far back, vertic
line appear on the screen.  thei ar everi 10 pixel or so, and seem
to be affect somewhat by open window and pull down menu.
it look to a semi-technic person like there is a loos connect
between the screen and the rest of the comput.

i am open to suggest that do not involv bui a new comput,
or take thi on to the shop.  i would also like to not have
to bui on of larri pina's book.  i like larri, but i'm not sure
i feel strongli enough about the comput to bui a servic manual
for it.

on a relat note:  what doe the monitor connector connect to?
