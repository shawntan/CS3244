ha anyon had ani problem with their duo dock not eject the duo
properli?

when i first got it, the duo would come out of the dock a coupl of inch
when eject, and i had to pull it the rest of the wai. nowadai (and i've
had the system for 4 month), the duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despit
the fact that the mechan make all the appropri nois, and i have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. is there a simpl fix for thi, or
do i have to return it to my appl dealer, where it will languish for week
while i have to make do with no colour displai, no vram, no floppi or
scsi etc. 

(btw, it's not that the duo is lock into the dock - it just doesn't
want to slide out ani more).
