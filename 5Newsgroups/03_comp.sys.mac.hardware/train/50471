line: 51

doe anyon know who make a cabl or adapt that is wire accord to
appl's spec that forc the extern output on lc's and the powerbook's
160/180 and duo 230 into a true vga style output signal? the nec adapt doe
not do thi sinc their monitor ar multisync thei just rout the signal into
the correct pinout but do not switch the mac output into vga mode.

do i have to make on of these or doe someon alreadi have on made-up??

the follow is the appl spec for the lc cpu vga cabl adapt. i'm assum
that the powerbook/duo will work with the same adapt(?);


macintosh lc to vga
 
the macintosh lc can suppli a 640 x 480, vga time signal for us with vga
monitor by us an adapt cabl.  the standard macintosh lc support vga to
16 color, and with the option 512k vram simm, the vga monitor is support
to 256 color.
 
note:     the macintosh lc suppli signal capabl of drive ttl level
          input.  howev, some low imped input vga monitor do not work
          with the macintosh lc.
 
to connect a macintosh lc to a vga monitor, you need to make an adapt cabl
from the macintosh lc video connector to the vga monitor.  follow is the
pinout descript for the adapt cabl:
 
macintosh lc        vga
video connector     pin     signal name
---------------     ----    -----------
1                   6       red ground
2                   1       red video signal
5                   2       green video signal
6                   7       green ground
9                   3       blue video signal
13                  8       blue ground
15                  13      /hsync
12                  14      /vsync
14                  10      hsync ground
7,10                nc      sens1 & sens2 ti togeth
 
vga monitor ar identifi by short pin 7 to pin 10 on the macintosh lc
video connector.  the macintosh lc ground pin 7 on it video connector, which
result in pull down pin 10 and give the correct monitor id for a vga
monitor.
