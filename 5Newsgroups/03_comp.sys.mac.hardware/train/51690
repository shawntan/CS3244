hello fellow human, and other net creatur...
 
if you're at all interest in thi merchandis, pleas e-mail me:
djk@ccwf.cc.utexa.edu
 
i'm compact my system and move to a singl monitor system, so i have
two monitor and card for sale. noth at all is wrong with these piec,
i'm just want to conserv desk space, and get all of my info from on
screen.
 
i'd prefer to sell to peopl near austin and surround area (within
drive distanc - like an hour awai perhap), but i can ship to you if you
don't live near here. onli problem is that i didn't keep the origin box
for the monitor, but i'm confid that my few month of full-time servic
in the ship room will enabl me to safe packag the monitor and
flip it in your direct.
 
detail:
 
mirror full page displai (monochrom) w/nubu card:
---------------------------------------------------
 
**sold**
 
soni 1304 14" color monitor:
----------------------------
what's to sai? it got top rate in last year's macus report. it's a soni,
trinitron, arguabl the best (but i'd rather not argu that point).
it's a great monitor, in great shape, but i'm go to a bigger screen,
and although i'd like to keep it, financ don't justifi it.
 
still sell for $599 at macland (where i bought it origin - not
includ ship), will sell for **$475** (plu ship). again, make an
offer if that sound unreason.
 
 
rasterop 24si (24-bit acceler, hardwar zoom/pan, 4 meg ram):
------------------------------------------------------------------
renam the 24sx a few month after i bought it, thi board is for 13"
monitor, provid **acceler 24-bit**, hardwar zoom/pan, ntsc mode
(you can plug it into someth like the rasterop video expand and output
ntsc), and 4 ram slot that us 1 meg or 4 meg simm for gworld ram, or a
ram disk. softwar includ for such function. 4 meg of ram includ (1 meg
simm).
 
sell for $605 at bottom line (without the ram - add $100), i'm ask
**$525** (ship includ thi time, it's just a card). origin box and
packag. i'd actual prefer to sell the soni monitor and thi card
togeth, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundl offer"
for these item.
 
------------
 
cheer.
