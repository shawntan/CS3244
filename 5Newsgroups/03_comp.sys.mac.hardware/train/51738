for the most part, thi is a bunch of bunk.  i've got a comput engin
degre, yet i've spent the last 7 year write softwar that peopl actual
us.  moreov, the salari distinct ar incorrect; i receiv 3 job offer
upon graduat; the two job that actual us my hardwar experi were
$7000/year lower!  my advic is to decid which class and project most
interest you, and pick the major that allow you to take them.
