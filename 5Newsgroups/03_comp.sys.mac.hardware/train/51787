batteri power devic like the powerbook ar sometim more sensit to 
serial port weird.  i had troubl with connect my mac plu to an hp 95lx
handheld.  everyth els work okai on that port, but not the hp. (it run
on two penlit batteri).  it turn out that the plu (by accid or by 
design flaw?) wa put a 4 volt bia on the serial port that wa do 
weird thing to the hp (which ha onli 3v dc!).  the hp work fine when 
connect to the printer port.  

doe your pb screen get dim or anyth when connect to the devic?  have you 
tri us the printer port?

good luck.
