doe gx take the place of 32 bit qd or add to it? right now 32 bit is
kinda aesthet a pain in a few place becaus of hack upon hack
to maintain compat with origin qd---i think of thing like
where you have to cast cgrafport to grafport and such. it would be a
lot cleaner to ditch thi entir mess and start over---do we get that?
