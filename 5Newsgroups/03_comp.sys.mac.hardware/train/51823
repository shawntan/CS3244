    appl ha realli confus peopl with thi whole thing. i think
we'll be answer thi question for about the next year or so. there is
no "option" to get an fpu on a c650. what you have is a choic of cpu:
there is the 68lc040 that doe not have an integr fpu like the full
'040 and is onli present in the base 4/80 model of the c650 (appleusa).
and there is the full '040 which you get when you order anyth other
than the base 4/80 configur. therefor, sinc you have order on
of the 8mb version with on-board ethernet model you will not be
get the lc040. but even if you want to have the lc040 you wouldn't
be abl to order a c650 with 8mb ram, on-board ethernet and an lc040.
it's not an "option."
    also, a note to peopl out there that have 4/80 c650s and c610s
think that there is an option fpu, the '040 class chip cannot
recogn an extern fpu, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a fpu chip and you cannot go out and purchas an fpu on a pd card or
someth like that. the onli wai to get an fpu in these machin is to
replac the lc040 with a full '040. and if you have a c610, you will not
need to worri about a heat sink if you do replac the lc040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 c650 you do need to have a heat sink.
