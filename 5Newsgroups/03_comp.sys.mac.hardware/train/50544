just thought i would mention that soni no longer manufactur the cpd-
1304 becaus of sever manufactur flaw.  the new model is now the
1430, which just like appl's new soni trinitrom claim to be 14 inch.
i'm not sure of the detail on the defect, but i work at our school
bookstor
and can tell you that nearli half of them were return with some kind of 
defect or anoth.

just my two cent worth.
