the 3fgx ha a maximum horizont scan rate of 49khz, so drive it
at 60.24khz to get 1024 x 768 on the mac is wai beyond the toler            the 4fg is spec'ed at 57khz, so go 60.24khz is onli 5-6% abov
the minim guarante figur.

i too doubt if the damark monitor would sync to a mac at 1024 x 768.            like most thing, you get what you pai.  that's the deal.
