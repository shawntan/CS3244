hi everyon. just the other dai, i order a vram chip for my new lciii from
mac connect. thei sent it overnight (veri nice) and i got it instal,
and we found that it didn't work properli. when you put the comput in 
thousand mode, the bottom of the screen (us the new chip) is all flicker
and fuzzi. so i call them up and i'm go to return it for a new on.

my question is, how often doe such a thing happen with simm chip in gener?
do you often find when order chip that a larg portion ar bad? is thi
a rariti? thi is the first chip i've order so i have no other experi
in thi area. i'm just curiou if anyon els ha had the same type of
experi.

that's about it. pleas email me, and if peopl want, i can post a summari.
thank all.
