sunni,

i ask thi question a while ago while contempl place my 650 on 
it's side.  i receiv a respons from someon at seagat (sorri i 
trash the messag) state that most newer drive (seagat at the 
least) can veri well compens for graviti.  thi mean that a 
horizont format drive can be later place vertic with no data 
integr problem.  the onli wai that newer drive cannot work is if you 
have vari forc (shake, bounc, etc) so don't place the drive on 
it's side on a rock chair :).  what constitut a 'newer' drive i 
don't know, try call your drive manufactur.  i have a quantum lp240s 
intern, and sinc i got it a month ago, i am guess it's 'newer'.
