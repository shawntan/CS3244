i can onli comment on thermal recalibr in gener. some new
drive perform it in order to increas overal integr of data
write. basic, the firmwar instruct the actuat to perform
a test to see if the data track ar within a certain physic
toler, sinc when the media heat up or cool down, *some*
track drift is inevit, and the drive ha to monitor it. thi
becom especi critic at veri high record densiti, and
so wa us primarili on veri larg-capac mechan, but it
seem to be find it wai into more smaller drive as a wai of
boost the drive's long-term reliabl and mtbf rate.

i first becam awar of thermal recalibr when it wa point
out that the techniqu conflict with prolong write time when
digit, sai, audio or video to hard disk. some manufactur
explicitli state that drive with thermal recalibr ar not
to be us for applic that have prolong disk write.

hope thi help.
