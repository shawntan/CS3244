the third-parti media adapt ar usual cheaper (at least in toronto) than
appl's. i bought the adapt from asant instead of appl.

that's not true. onli the decstat 5000/200 come with a thinwir
(bnc, coaxial) ethernet connector. the 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240
all have a singl 15-pin aui ethernet connector onli. i distinctli
rememb thi becaus when got the 5000/200 first and i thought all
of them ar go to be thinwir. i eventu had to go back and order
desta (dec's overs version of an aui-to-bnc adapt that must be us
with a transciev cabl) for the rest of the station.

my advis to the veri origin poster (beverli?) is:

(1) if all you want is to creat a lan with two workstat and won't add
    machin to it ever, go for thinwir regardless of the media type. go
    for utp (unshield twist pair) wire requir a concentr which
    mean extra monei and i believ these unit come with at least 6 port.
    as for thicknet, it's a nightmar and cabl is expens. avoid it
    unless you have no choic (e.g. the two machin ar two floor part).

(2) on the mac side, you will need:
    - on thinwir media adapt (from appl or third-parti).
    - macx (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on system 7.1).
    - mactcp (which come with macx; if you get macx v1.2, you should be
      get mactcp v1.1.1 with it. don't us earlier version on a centri).
    - you mai or mai not need a 25ohm termin depend on the
      thinwir media adapt. so just ask the sale if the adapt is
      self-termin or not.
    - configur mactcp to us "ethernet".

(3) on the decstat side, you will need:
    - for a model 200, you will onli need a t-connector.
    - for model 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an aui-to-bnc adapt.
      get on that can be plug in directli to the aui port of the
      decstat. thi wai you save the cost of a transciev cabl
      (a 15-pin aui male to a 15-pin aui femal cabl).
    - get a 25ohm termin.

your two-machin network will look like thi:
