   i have test thi on a 230 and it doe work there.  so it would
seem that the 140 and 170 ar out though.  on wai to tell is to
go and open the powerbook control panel(7.1).  there is a set
there that allow you to set the time to wake up the mac.  if it
is present when you open the control panel, then you can assum that
setwutim will work.
