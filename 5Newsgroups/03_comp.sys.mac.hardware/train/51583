for a good displai, you *must* get an activ matrix panel and a *veri*
bright overhead projector design to be us with an lcd panel (i.e.
stage must not get too hot). i tri out a proxima ovat unit and like
it, but i need a brighter projector (i us it with a 3m 920). it is
also too expens for what you get, imho. price of activ matrix panel
ar rumour to drop substanti sometim thi year (someth to do
with tarrif be lift i think). 

in canadian dollar, the proxima ovat model rang in price from about
$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. for
that kind of monei, you can get a brighter imag from a three beam
projector, but sacrific portabl.

oh ye, proper room light is extrem import, especi if you
want your audienc to have enough light to read handout and not have that
light wash out your displai at the front of the room. tricki to get right.
