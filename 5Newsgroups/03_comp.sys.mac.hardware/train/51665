i've had my duo 230 for a few week now and suffer from both
of the abov problem. i reinstal my system softwar twice
in an effort to combat the problem - think thei were
system softwar problem. initi reinstal the system
seem to help but not anymor. occasion when i try to
wake up the duo i get a solid screen of horizont line on
the screen - it freez.

i also get the high-pitch hiss occasion - but onli at
startup.

i've call the appl hotlin (800 so-appl) three time
alreadi and final thei agre someth is astrai after my
duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. thi problem onli occur
twice. appl sent me a box to ship my duo to be look at in
new york but the problem now is intermitt and i can't
afford to be without my duo at thi time.

anyon out there with these same problem?
