the origin poster (w g wright) post an item sai that he had bought a new
wizz-bang laser printer from appl (a select 300 i think) which can print
grayscal. he then said that he cannot print grayscal from hi se comput
(and also that all the 'expert' he ha dealt with agre that it is not
possibl).

thi is the on major bugbear about do a 3rd parti se upgrad (compar to
appl's se to se/30 upgrad): you will never be abl to run color quickdraw. it
is color quickdraw that control color and grayscal.

se can print some colour: thi is becaus quickdraw - the origin, non-colour
version, ha the right hook for eight colour. some of you will rememb the
'scsigraph' solut to get a colour screen for your se (i think that it
gave you sixteen colour by dither or someth).

there is no reason that appl couldn't releas softwar patch for older
comput (there ar lot of mac pluse, classic and se that have been
upgrad to 68020 and 68030 processor which should be perfectli abl to deal
with color quickdraw) - but thei wont, and 3rd parti ar have a difficult 
time in duplic the mac's rom (i.e. nutek et al.).

just on caveat: i would have thought that if you were print a postscript
grayscal imag onto a postscript grayscal printer, that you would be abl to
do so, whatev mac you were us. (and i am pretti sure that the select 300
is not a postscript printer [? correct me if i'm wrong?]).
