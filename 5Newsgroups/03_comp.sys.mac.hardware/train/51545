the servic notic on the 13" hi-re monitor expir 3/23/93 after thi  
date appl will not reimburs servic provid for the fix (replac  
of the hi-voltag capacitor). all you folk that have been put up with  
intermitt shutdown without get it to your servic provid miss  
out on the freebi. it wa in forc for a year. if you got it free after  
3/23, you got a deal...
