>1) spec for the 68040 (esp. how it compar to the pentium)

spec for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  some highlight ar...
32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integ regist 
& 8 80-bit float point regist.  8k copyback capabl cach,
4-wai set associ.  typic 1.2 clock/integ instruct.  5
clock for a float point multipli.

(interest asid: the 68040 can multipli two 80-bit float point
number in less time than it can multipli two 32-bit integ)

>2) spec for the 68060 with estim cost, releas date, etc...

more of the same but with multipl instruct dispatch.  figur
about 0.8 clock per instruct typic (my guess).  but the motorola
gui ar pretti bright, it mai be less.

call motorola.  i'm not type it all in.

>i am hope that the 68040 can win yet anoth battl against the intel peopl.

i'm predict that both the 680x0 and x86 line ar reach their
end.  new experiment processor have 64-bit data pathwai and can
schedul up to 8 out of 32 instruct each clock cycl.  that sort
of trick can't realli be done with cisc architectur.

i final saw some detail on the 586/pentium and wa not greatli
impress.  thei've final done some work on the fpu to get it up to
speed, but otherwis it's onli go to be a 2x speedup.  and to get
that thei're us two integ unit, larger cach, and a branch
target buffer.  ye, i know thei're talk about 100mhz processor.
big whoop.  design a 100mhz board is difficult and realli
expens.  price 15ns memori chip late?
