i rememb read a thread a few dai ago that mention remov an extern
syquest drive from it case and drop it in the intern drive of a centri.
. . i wa go to do that with my 610, but had a coupl of question.  my
pli 80m syquest drive ha a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the
outsid of the case.  where do i connect thi switch??  can the comput just
"tell" with intern drive?  
	i notic that the drive will lai over part of the motherboard (i
didn't look close, but i seem to recal it lai over the ram that's
solder onto the motherboard?  would that caus problem?
	on last question!  is there anywher to order a facepl cover?  
the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the
drive's panel is the same size as the spotsbm clone's case).  should i just
cut a hole in the plastic panel that is current hold tmpty place?

an ar welcom!  thank!
