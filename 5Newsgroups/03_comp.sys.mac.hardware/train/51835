hi!
a while back, there wa a thread in thi group about the us of the iwii
in europ (in countri with 50 hz ac current).  the consensu at the time
wa that the iwii would not work there.  as i will be move there thi summer,
i call appl to make sure and thei told me (todai) that the iwii (as bought
in the u.s.) will definit run on 50 hz ac current (as long as a step-down
convert is emploi if 240 v current is us).  the same info, turn out, can
be found in the iwii manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but i didn't realli
trust that.  doe anyon have ani direct experi to the contrari?  just 
wonder.

chri w.
