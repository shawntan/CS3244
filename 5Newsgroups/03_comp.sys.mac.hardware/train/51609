ravi,

	it not a good idea to have a horizont format hard disk in a  
vertic posit.  if the drive is format in a horizont posit, it can  
not complet compens for the gravit pull in a vertic posit.   
i'm not sai that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 month from now, but  
why take that chanc?  if you want more detail info on the problem, pleas  
mail me at:===> sunnyt@dna.bch.uh.edu <===.
