  ye, e-machin make two mini-dock--the powerlink present and the
powerlink desknet. the present offer a varieti of video-out option, 
includ ntsc, rgb and svga. it also ha sound out, floppi drive port
and a power port. unfortun no scsi port and it block the serial port.
  the desknet ha the standard port plu built-in ethernet. ala, none of
these have an fpu.
  in the futur, rasterop is put out a mini-dock, but the name escap
me now. it is suppos to support 16-bit color and "quadra" compar
video speed. no idea if it ha an fpu.
  hope thi help...
