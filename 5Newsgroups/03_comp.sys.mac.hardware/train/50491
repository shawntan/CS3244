alain:
get your fact straight befor you post someth like thi.  the duo
dock doe not have a cpu of it own.  it is a dock station with 
port connect variou compon, includ the portabl powerbook
with it own cpu.  i guess these rumor new duo dock have a built-in
cpu to perform function of their own.  interest!  if thei're not
compat with the current duo model, i think you'll be hear a
lot more "screw by appl" complaint.  imagin a compani obsolet
(ooh, a new verb!) a virtual brand new comput... sheesh...
