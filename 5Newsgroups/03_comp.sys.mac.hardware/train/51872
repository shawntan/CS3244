the subject sai what i would like to do, here ar the detail:

i have a 512ke with the macrescu upgrad board that make it the
equival of a plu (system 7 and macenvi both identifi it as such).

the macrescu board clip onto the 68000 on the mb.  it also ha
a 68000 itself.  period i have to remov the clip (not an
entir easi thing to do) and clean the "leg" of the 68000.
larri pina's book assert that thi is occasion a problem with
snap on upgrad:  the 68000's "leg" will oxid, caus 
unusu system error.

well, that's me.

so, i would like to do someth perman, and i think it would be
fairli easi to put a socket in where the 68000 current is, and
modifi the macrescu board to plug in.  what i'm not 100% sure of
is whether it will work.  it seem to me that the two 68000s aren't
act independ; so remov on shouldn't have ani effect on
the perform of my mac.  i'm about 97% sure.

will someon provid the extra 3%?
