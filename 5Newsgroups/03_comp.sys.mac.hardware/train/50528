1.  why, or how actual, can a powerbook have a 640 x 400 pixel
    displai, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the
    72 dpi resolut?  (i assum that it doesn't, and i don't 
    mean to impli thei *all* have these dimens)


2.  ani info on price drop or new model (non-duo) come up?



thank,
jt
