there's thi old se here. it's got the older-style fan that remind
me of a hous-ventil. a cylindr drum instead of the blade rotor
i usual see. anywai, the se make thi loud buzz nois due
to vibrat somewher. if i remov the screw and loosen the front
from the back, it quiet down. i can onli assum that the fan hous
from thi goofi thing is touch the back of the case and vibrat
against it. 

anywai, ani suggest for where to get replac fan and how to
"stealth" thi gui? your experi welcom.....
