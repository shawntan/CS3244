benchmark ar for market dweeb and cpu envi.  ok, if it will make
you happi, the 486 is faster than the 040.  bfd.  both architectur
ar near then end of their lifetim.  and especi with the x86
architectur: good riddanc.

the point be the processor speed is onli on of mani aspect of a
comput perform.  clock speed, processor, memori speed, cpu
architectur, i/o system, even the applic program all contribut 
to the overal system perform.

look them up yourself.
