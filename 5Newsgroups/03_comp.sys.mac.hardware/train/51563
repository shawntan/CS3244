ben,

sinc you're obvious adept enough to understand how the trackbal work,
the onli thing short of repair it that i can think of is a thorough
clean of all the part, and then check for the proper placement of
the littl blue roller. sinc thei aren't fix in posit on their
stainless steel pin, you might try slide them into a slightli differ
posit. on my powerbook 100, i can slide them almost complet out of
contact with the trackbal. in fact, on of the note from sumex on fix
the trackbal advoc slide the roller so that it _edg_ contact the
ball, not the center cylindr area.

i've done thi with my pb100, and it doe seem to improv the feel, but
need to be adjust from time to time. i just pop open on of our
offic's pb170s, and while there isn't as much latitud for movement, on
could still adjust the roller slightli. if your pb140 is the same it might
help.

i would suspect the most like culprit to be a slipperi blue roller. if
you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapi solut, or isopropyl 
alcohol. also, be sure the ball is greas-free.

if you drop the ball in minu the retain ring, roll the ball and see
if it is actual caus the axl to spin. 

if all thi still doesn't solv it, then mayb a new on is in order. :-(
it could be an electr connect, in which case replac would be
necessari. but my experi with both mice and trackbal ha been that
dirt ha been the normal problem, not an electr malfunct.

hope thi help,

murrai
