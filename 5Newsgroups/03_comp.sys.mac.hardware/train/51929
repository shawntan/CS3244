can some peopl with cach card pleas post speedomet number thei get
with the card. i have onli on report, which seem to indic that
a 32k cach card give you onli about a 1% speedup!! access to memori take
longer when you have a cach card(and get a miss) thu a small cach card
of 32k mai be worth $0. i don't know what kind of number 64k card get
you. also i found it interest that you can disabl the cach card
via softwar(read about it in the mac iisi tech note from ftp.appl.com)

so is $99 a good deal or not, i still don't know.
