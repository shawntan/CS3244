i think you ar suffer from some align or color
tabl or <whatev> problem, if a color classic is as fast
as a quadra render to screen.

what screen card you us doe of cours matter much (built-in
video is almost alwai faster than nubu)

or you measur "scroll entir screen" where the color classic
had a vram 10" screen in 4-bit color and the quadra had a
21" 24-bit screen on nubu :-)

cheer,
