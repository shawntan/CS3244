i have a (veri old) mac 512k and a mac plu, both of which 
have the same problem.

their screen blank out, sometim after a minor physic jolt
(such as insert a floppi in the intern drive), sometim 
all by themselv (comput left to itself just goe blank).

i have replac the wire connect the logic board and the 
video board, becaus it seem at first that jiggl the wire
made the screen come back on.  thi work for a while, but the
blank out ha return.

can i do anyth?  do i need a new power suppli?  a new crt?
a new comput?

thank for ani advic...
