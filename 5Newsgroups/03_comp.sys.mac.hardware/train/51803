   i seem to be have some troubl with thi...

   i can get the mac to go to sleep, but i can't make seem to 
make it wake up with setwutim().  i am awar of the error in
the header file and im vi.  i am set the wu time to be
about two minut, then put the mac to sleep, but it doesn't
wakeup at the appoint time....

   doe it requir a call to systemtask in order to make sure that
everyth is setup?
