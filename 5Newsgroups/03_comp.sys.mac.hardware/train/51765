if you get the centri 650 with cd configur, you ar get a mac with
a 68rc040 processor that ha built-in math coprocessor support.  my 
understand is that the "option fpu" refer to your option of purchas
the centri 650 4/80 without fpu or on of the other configur with fpu.

appl doe not offer an upgrad from the non-fpu system to becom an fpu
system.  and, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-fpu system
(a 68lc040) can be replac with a 68rc040 suppli by anoth vendor.
appl did send a memo out at on point sate that the centri 610, which onli
come with a non-fpu 68lc040 processor cannot be upgrad to support an fpu -
the pin configur of the two chip appar do not match so you cannot
swap on for anoth (again, accord to appl's memo).

hope that help.
