you're not go to like thi, but if memori serv me, post
i've read in thi newsgroup and elsewher indic that there ar
no, repeat no, intern modem for the duo besid the express
modem... at _ani_ speed.  someth have to do with the modem
us the main cpu for some of it task, and appl not releas
detail on the architectur, or someth.  i'm vagu on the
detail, but the gist wa that there ar go to be no
third-parti intern duo modem.  if i'm wrong, somebodi pleas
correct me on thi.  sorri to be the bearer of bad new.
