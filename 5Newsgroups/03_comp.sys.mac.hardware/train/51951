what i did not get with my drive (cd300i) is the system instal cd you
list as #1.  ani idea about how i can get on?  i bought my iivx 8/120
from direct express in chicago (no complaint at all -- good price & good
servic).

btw, i've heard that the system instal cd can be us to boot the mac;
howev, my drive will not accept a cd caddi is the machin is off.  how can
you boot with it then?
