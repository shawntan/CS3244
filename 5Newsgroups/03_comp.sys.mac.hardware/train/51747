how about some number here? some kind of benchmark?
if you want, let me start it - 486dx2-66 - 32 specint92, 16 specfp92 .

number? pentium @66mhz - 65 specint92, 57 specfp92 .
	 powerpc @66mhz - 50 specint92, 80 specfp92 . (note thi is the 601)
        (alpha @150mhz  - 74 specint92,126 specfp92 - just for comparison)

not in a clock-doubl system. there isn't a doubl in perform, but
it _is_ quit signific. mayb about a 70% increas in perform.

besid, for 0 wait state perform, you'd need a cach anywai. i mean,
who us a processor that run at the speed of 80ns simm? note that thi
memori speed correspond to a clock speed of 12.5 mhz.
