hmmm... sound vagu similar to a problem i had a long time ago when i wa  
try to us kermit.  i wa build a serial connect between my duo 210  
and my next.  i think the problem wa in the handshak.  basic, you need  
to make sure that the handshak protocol is the same on both side.  a safe  
place to start is by select no handshak on either end.  on problem is  
that the zilog serial chip seem to get perman wedg if you talk to it  
wrong, and onli a reset will clear it.  i don't know the specif.  but thi  
could be a nonlinear that screw up your attempt at debug the system.   
it could veri well be that you ar do thing right--eventu-- but on  
wrong move (like try a bad handshak protocol) can screw up ani further  
correct action, until the next machin reset.  i have wedg my mac and also  
my next that wai.

now i can send file back and forth between the duo and the next without ani  
problem, and at pretti high speed too.

i don't know what kind of chip the pc us, but i think the zilog 8530 is  
pretti standard.

hope thi help,
