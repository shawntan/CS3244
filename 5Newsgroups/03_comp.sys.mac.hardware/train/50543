i believ that in order to get at the innard of the new mous,
you must remov the label on the bottom that sai "appl desktop
bu mous ii"  there you should find two screw on either side.
i haven't tri it myself yet, but when i ran my fingernail
accross the label, these two divot appear, and i can onli assum
that these ar the elus screw in question.

cheer,
john
