ye, it is possibl to add a second hard drive to a mac iicx intern. thi
is definit not a recommend procedur by appl but i have done the equival to my cx after upgrad it to a quadra 700. the power suppli is still the
stock cx's and it wa abl to power two quantum lp drive, a pli scsi 
acceler, a micron technolog 24 bit video board, daystar quickcach,
new technolog overdr and 20 meg of ram simultan.

i ad a new mount for the drive by attach angl bracket to the drive
tower. the intern scsi cabl wa chang to a longer flat ribbon cabl onto
which i ad an extra connector about midwai. the final hd wa intern
termin and the drive between the motherboard and final hd had it termin resistor pack remov. cool ha not been a problem and no scsi problem
occur with either the pli scsi chain or motherboard scsi hook into the two
intern hard drive.

it work veri well for me, but proce cautious if you wish to do the same.
