a quick queri for powerbook guru:
tom spearman, in a post on altern powerbook batteri option
mention that there exist 3 version of their powerbook 140-180
batteri: a 2.5 amp hour on (m5545/a), a 2.8 amp hour on,
(m5545/b) and a 2.9 amp hour on (m5545/c). anyon out there
know how to determin which of these a batteri is? i look at my
batteri and there is no obviou exterior indic. i contact
tom spearman who had glean the inform from macus and he
didn't know either. anyon out there know the answer?
