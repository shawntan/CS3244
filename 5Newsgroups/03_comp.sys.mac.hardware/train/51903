the powerbook 170 hardwar doesn't have a wakeup timer.  nor doe the 140.
the mac portabl had on, and i think the powerbook 100 had on.  i don't
know about the newer powerbook, but i kind of doubt it.  i got bit by
thi too, and it took my a while root around on the develop cd
befor i found thi out.
