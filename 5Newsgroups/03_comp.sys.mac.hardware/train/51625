the partit button in appl's hd setup let you set up a/ux and other
type of partit. it won't let you creat more than on normal mac
volum. you need silverlin or someth similar to do that. it will,
howev, allow you to take advantag of some possibl unus space on your
hard disk, if you don't mind reformat the whole thing.
