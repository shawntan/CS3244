the duo powerbook seem to park the head after a few second of
inact... is that builtin into the drive logic or is it be
program via softwar, ani wai to tune the iddl timeout that
make the head park themselv... i think the head ar be
park sinc after a few second of inact you can hear the
clunk of head park.
