  complet q700 ar best obtain from your dealer or some recent
copi of macworld or macus.  my foggi memori suggest that the most relev
comparison factor vi-a-vi a iici ar as follow:

  25 mhz 68040
  16 mhz data path (don't recal thi for sure, but it's slower
      than q 950 style machin for sure).
  ethertalk card on-board
  audio in/out
  4 mb ram on motherboard
  4 simm slot
  2 nubu slot.
  more flexibl build-in video than the ci.  us vram.

in comparison, a iici with an acceler won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video option.
  with a 68040 acceler, cpu perform can be compar but i
  think it end up cost more.
