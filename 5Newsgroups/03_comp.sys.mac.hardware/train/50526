i want to achiev an overal throughput rate of around 5 megabyt / sec
for veri larg data transfer.  (around 5 mb.)

i have a quadra 950. 
i have a nubu network card that can pump data in to mac memori at 8.5 mb/s.
         (us block-mode transfer)
i have a high-speed disk arrai (no asynchron pb call) that can
         achiev 6.8 mb/s.

let's sai all transfer go from disk to buffer to network card.

it is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,
then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 mb/s then 8.5 mb/s
result in an overal 3.8 mb/s.  too slow!)

so i tri the follow scheme: for an n-megabyt transfer, 

step 1:                                load the 1st mb from disk to buffer.
step 2: asynch send 1st mb out card,   load the 2nd mb from disk to buffer.
step 3: asynch send 2nd mb out card,   load the 3rd mb from disk to buffer.
        ...
step n: asynch send the n-1 mb out card, load the nth mb from disk to buffer.
step n+1: send the nth mb out card.

even though the code appar doe execut the card transfer asynchron,
and the card doe not us the mac cpu at all,  (it is us the buffer, tho')
each of the step 2 through n take as long as if the two transfer were
execut on after anoth.  so there is no improv in the rate.

why?

is the mac ram dual-port?  (so the nubu card and the disk driver can both
access data at the same time.)
is the problem that the two devic, card and disk driver, both have to us
the same bu to mac ram?

is there anyth i can do?
