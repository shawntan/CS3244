    i think thi is mostli the fault of the peopl who write up the
literatur and price list be confus themselv. sinc there ar
two possibl processor configur and on of the them doesn't have
an fpu it doe seem to be an option, even though it realli isn't.

    well, then allow me to end your confus. the c650 onli come with
an lc040 in the base 4/80 configur. if you ar not get thi
configur then you ar get an fpu.

>>why sai "option" if it's built in?

    good question. i have been wonder that sinc feb. 10th.

    thi is possibl, but an option is someth that you ar suppos
to be abl to request when you want it. what appl ha done is given the
buyer a choic between configur and not an option.

    thi is not unclear at all. in fact appl ha includ in the rom
of those machin with lc040s code to recogn the presenc of the full
040's fpu and us it. therebi make the upgrad as easi as switch
chip. you pop the lc040 out and pop in a full '040.

    thei did? i think i would doubl-check thi. it ha been state
countless time in thi newsgroup by two of the centri hardwar
design that the lc040 and the full '040 ar pin compat and that
the c610 can be upgrad to a full '040.
