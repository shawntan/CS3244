	well, i just got my centri 610 yesterdai.  it took just over two 
week from place the order.  the dealer (rutger comput store) 
appolog becaus appl made a substitut on my order.  i order
the on without ethernet, but thei substitut on _with_ ethernet.
he want to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  thei must
be backlog on centri w/out ethernet so thei're just ship them
with!  

	anywai, i'm veri happi with the 610 with a few except.  
be nosi, i decid to open it up _befor_ power it on for the first
time.  the scsi cabl to the hard drive wa onli partial connect
(must have come loos in ship).  no big deal, but i would have been
piss if i tri to boot it and it wouldn't come up!
	the hard drive also ha an annoi high pitch whine.  i've
heard appl will exchang it if you complain, so i might try to get
it swap.
	i am also dissappiont by the lack of soft power-on/off.  thi
wasn't mention in ani of the literatur i saw.  also, the locat
of the reset/interupt button is aw.  have keyboard control for
these function wa much more conveni.
	oh, and the screen seem tojump in a wierd wai on power-up.
i've seen thi mention by other, so it must be a...featur...
	anywai, abov all, it's fast.  a great machin at a great price!
