the iivx...lciii perform at a centri 610 price. the onli reason
to get an iivx is if you realli need the full-size nubu slot. keep 
in mind that the 610 support all appl monitor and ha option ethernet.
thi lessen (but doesn't elimin) the need for nubu card. and unless
you're run fpu-intens softwar, the 610 will blow the door off the
lciii and the iivx. the lciii, on the other hand, is suffici for most
peopl and ha a great price.

if you haven't guess, i find halv the bu clock (the iivx 32mhz up vs.
16mhz bu) a throughli bad thing and i hope appl never doe it again.
