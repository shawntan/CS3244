i'm current have troubl connect my pb to a true blue (ibm model
1513) vga monitor.  the displai is bearli readabl but all the detail ar
seper into yellow and red color. ie. a window will have two imag on
in yellow and a ghost imag in red.  the background is also a littl
greenish.  i read some time ago, befor i ever thought i would hook my mac
up to a vga screen, about an incompat with some vga monitor due to
the sync on green signal.  doe thi sound like it could be the same demon?
 i also read that there ar both hardwar (put a diod on the green
signal?) solut and a softwar solut to thi problem.  i don't the
detail doe somebodi have them the can e-mail to me or post them?  i
check all the faq's for thi and didn't find anyth about it.  did i
miss it somewher?  thi sure seem that it would be a good thing to have
in on.  thank for ani repli.
