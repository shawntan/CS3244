so, will it be possibl to have a nubu or pd powerpc upgrad, or will it 
requir a logic board swap? it would be interest for appl to come out with
a nubu powerpc that allow us of the cpu's 680x0, like rocketshar. but i 
guess that's get a bit fantast!

i wa wonder, sinc macweek report that develop were 'seed' with
powerpc on a nubu card.

also, ani word on machin arriv or estim speed? last i heard, the 
estim were around 3-4 time the speed of a quadra in nativ risc mode. i
heard an appl employe mumbl someth about the arriv of powerpc machin
at a much earlier date that q1 94, but i doubt it's true.

final, is the powerpc develop's cd 'mini-cours' avail? i saw it 
advertis in the develop's univers calendar, and i'd like to know if it's
at all *interest*.
