my wife ha on of these.  i have not had much chanc to fiddl with
it, but in comparison to our laserwrit with canon engin, she
complain that the print is too light for her tast.  the differ
is quit appar even when the print set on the select 310 is
adjust to the darkest possibl level.  i don't find it
objection, and inde rather like it, but be warn that some
peopl don't care for it and it is consider differ. 

i recal that year ago there were lot of debat over write-black
vs. write-white engin when deal with tex driver.  is someth
like that go on here?
