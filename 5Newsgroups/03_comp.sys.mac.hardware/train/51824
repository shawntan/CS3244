  what you need is a hardwar router such as etherrout/tcp made by
compat system ($1400).  thi will allow you to connect your localtalk
network (4 mac) to your ethernet network (next and ethernet mac).  it will
rout tcp/ip protocol between the two network.  softwar router ar also
avail for less monei, but i'm not sure if thei work with tcp/ip.
