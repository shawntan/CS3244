hello mr. au,

i have to disagre regard your assess of macintosh in hong kong. the mac ha a sizeabl share of the typeset market, as in the u.s. a local magazin, next magazin (similar to newsweek here), us the mac extens. i have seen sir speedi and other franchis in hong kong equip with mac-base system. true, the discount is not as steep as here becaus custom in hong kong cannot bui from grai market, nor ar mac be sold thru mass merchandis like appl doe here with the performa lin


e. at thi point the sale of mac is handl by on exclus distributor. on the other hand, you can alwai get a pc clone or in the earlier dai, illeg clone of the appl iie.

your percept of the mac not be too popular in hong kong is simpli becaus most hobbyist and user find it much cheaper to go to on of those basement store that sell pc clone with probabl illeg copi of bio than to pai for a mac.

similarli you cannot sai lotu 1-2-3 sure is not well accept in hong kong becaus the sale is so low. mai be it is becaus of all those place in kowloon where illeg copi of lotu 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a profession look but illeg copi of the manual.
