no, he's not miss anyth.  you're right that some model of the 650 ship in
the usa without fpu or ethernet.  per ejeklint is also right -- *all*, i repeat,
*all* centri 650's sold here in new zealand and, i assum, europ have the fpu
and ethernet.

i know.  i bought a 650 4/80 and it ha both fpu and ethernet.
