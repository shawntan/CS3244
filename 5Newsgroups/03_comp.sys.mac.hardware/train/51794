regard the post for inform about the mac portabl and the 
powerbook 100, here ar a coupl of the answer:
(1) doe the mac portabl support appletalk? ye
(2) what cpu is in the mac portabl? a low power version of the 68000 
run at 15.87 mhz.
(3) doe the mac portabl run system 7? ye, although it doe us up a 
lot of memori.
(4) is memori still availab for the portabl? there ar sever vendor 
that still make ram for the portabl. there ar two option: some vendor 
sell memori that plug into the ram slot insid the portabl. other sell 
memori that plug into the processor direct slot. either wai, the most 
memori you can address is either 8 or 9 megabyt, depend on whether 
the portabl is backlit or not. king memori and peripheri in irvin 
california is the cheapest place i know of for portabl memori. 2mb - 
$140, 4 mb, $250, and 7 mb $415. i still see sever ad in macus that 
ar sell 4 mb modul for $450. wide varieti in price here.
(5) what is the intern hd? it a conner cp-3045 40 mb hd with an 
averag access time of about 25 ms.
(6) is the screen better that the pb 100? heaven ye! the pb 100 is a 
backlit passiv matrix screen which mean it fade out on you if you move 
your head a few degre left or right. the portabl ha a backlit or 
non-backlit activ matrix screen which i think is a joi to read.

other thing to consid - where to get the portabl and how much to pai 
for it? a good supplier ha been selectterm in mass. thei were will to 
sell a 2mb non-backlit portabl with an intern 2400 bp modem for about 
$650. or a 4 mb backlit portabl with an intern 2400 bp modem for 
about $900. 

the answer is call around for a good while or you'll pai too much.

i'm still look for an intern fax modem for the portabl? anybodi got 
on thei want to sell? -- good luck, gene wright
