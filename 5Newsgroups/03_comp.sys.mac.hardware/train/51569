noooooooo!  i've been servic mac for year too, and i've had to
repair a number of motherboard that had been damag thi wai.  it's
rare, but it doe happen.

mind you, thi doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  the part that can
blow (the adb power fuse and rf filter) aren't too expens, so if you
have a someon around who can do compon-level repair, it mai be worth
the risk (especi if you're around seattl, 'caus you might get to
pai *me* to fix it :-))..  on the other hand, if your onli repair option
is the appl-standard logic board swap (major $$$$), you should probabl
plai it safe.

scsi: ye, adb: ye, floppi: ye...  thei can all caus troubl.
