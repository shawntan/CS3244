we have recent obtain a centri 610 and it ha develop an unusu
video problem. 

model:	610 with 8 mb/230 hd, 512k vram, no card
monitor:	appl 16"

when the comput is set for 256 color and certain oper ar done,
particularli vertic scroll through a window, horizont white line
appear on the monitor (which gener but not alwai spare open
window).  these line accummul as the oper is continu.  if a
window is move over the involv area of the screen and then move awai
the line disappear from that area of the screen.  thi problem is not
observ if the monitor is configur for 16 color or a 14 inch appl
monitor with 256 color is us. 

i suspect a bad video ram chip but cannot be certain.  the problem ha
been appar sinc dai 1 but ha gotten wors.
