have you tri the librari?
sinc you go to wpi (so do i), go to ak and look on the first floor, a 
professor ha post an ieee (i believ) spec sheet on the 68060 which
is around 10 page long.  i'm sure the librari ha the info you request, it's
just a matter of find it.


hope thi help,
bret chase
