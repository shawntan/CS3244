i have been us the pli (soni) 3.5" mo drive and now a sharp color
scanner us standard scsi cabl and standard $20 termin on my q700. 
no problem.  if you were us a iifx, that might be anoth stori.

make sure there is onli on termin in the cabl and it must be at the
end.  some box have intern termin; some can be switch out and
other ar socket.  these count.  if the box with intern termin
cannot be put on the end to termin the cabl, thei have to be
disabl, ie, switch out or pull out of their socket.  if you have 2
box with intern termin, the termin in on box ha to be
disabl...., etc.  i am sure that thi ha been cover by the "expert".

my experi with scsi box that connect to the mac indic that thei
must have some softwar packag for the mac to 'talk' to them.  my pli mo
drive and sharp scanner ha on for each.

good luck.
