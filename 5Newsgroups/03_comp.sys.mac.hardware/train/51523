i would be veri wari of retail outlet sell as cheap as educ price!
i went for a retail, actual mail order (cda comput), becaus it price
wa better thant the campu comput store. i found out why later on when i
tri to get a repair done at an appl regist repair center - the cpu wa a
resal. the serial number had been remov and replac with a non-standard
number (probabl from cda comput). consequ, the appl repair man could
not do ani warrenti repair. so i end up with just a 90dai warrenti from cda
over the appl 12month warrenti. boi, wa i pi**ed! moral of the stori, caveat
emptor.

howev, if you go with a reliabl, trustworthi mail order firm (if thei exist
- mayb someon could enlighten us with their experi), you will probabl
get a better price than your local educ outlet simpli becaus mail order
out of state doe not requir sale tax yet. though for how much longer remain
to be seen. the addit in sale tax on a cpu purchas will probabl wipe out
an educ discount. again caveat emptor, some mail order compani do
includ sale tax on purchas even if thei ar out of state, so check!
