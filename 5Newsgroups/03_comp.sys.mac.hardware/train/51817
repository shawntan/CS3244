    to displai million of color on a 16" monitor you need 2mb of vram
in the q950.

    ye thi is possibl. technic, you onli need to take out 2 of
the vram simm but leav in the other two will not get you anyth
becaus the 950 cannot realli do anyth with 1.5mb of vram. it onli
know 1mb and 2mb.

>16-bit color, is that correct?

    ye, thi is correct. you get to 1mb by put 2 256k vram simm
into the vram simm slot on the q800's motherboard.
