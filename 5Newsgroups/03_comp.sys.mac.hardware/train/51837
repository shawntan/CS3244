we're about readi to take a bold step into the 90s around here by acceler
our rather larg collect of stock macplu comput. ye inde, difficult
to comprehend why anyon would want to acceler a macplu, but that's anoth
stori. suffuc it to sai, we can get acceler easier than new machin.
hei, i don't make the rule...

anywai, on to the purpos of thi post: i'm look for info on macplu
aceler.  so far, i've found some lit on the novi acceler and the
micrmac multispe accelartor. both look accept, but i would like to hear
from anyon who ha tri these.  also, if someon would recommend anoth
acceler for the macplu, i'd like to hear about it.

thank for ani time and effort you expend on thi!
