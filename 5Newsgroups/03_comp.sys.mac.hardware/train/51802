some kind soul told me that i could chang the serial port buffer size
of zterm via resedit. he did not tell me how i could chang it us
resedit, and i have lost hi e-mail address.

could he or ani on els pleas tell me what to do?

i assum that the relev resourc is zset, but i do not know, and
i have no templat for that resourc. if you have a tmpl for the correct
resourc, i would be grate to receiv it. that wai, i could plai around
a bit and mayb get my duo to do someth us with it serial port.
(other than appletalk).

btw, i believ that when the port stat sai that maximum in buffer is
3074 byte, that that mean increas the buffer will help, if you ar
us hardwar handshak. i can cram text data pretti fast into my duo,
and can monitor that ct is be lower, but the buffer never get beyond
3074 (out of 4096) byte. make sens to me.
