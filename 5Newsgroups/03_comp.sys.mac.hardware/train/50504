i'm have a real tough time find out the proper adapt to us a vga
monitor (an ibm 8513 sold w/ mani ps/2's to be exact) on the mac lc iii. 
all of the vendor i have call sai that the intern video will not work
on a true vga monitor but will work on a ibm compat multisync like the
soni's or the nec monitor.  i thought the vga capabl of lciii wa veri
attract becaus it allow you to us inexpens vga monitor.  am i
confus or ar these vendor just not up to speed?  ha anyon us an
lciii with a non multisync vga monitor and if so where did you get your
adapt (pleas be specif w/ vendor and cat #)?  i would prefer to get a
appl monitor for these lciii's (it's unseemli to see the finder insid an
ibm bezel) but the more monei we save on monitor the more lciii's we can
afford and the more ps/2's we can get rid of!
