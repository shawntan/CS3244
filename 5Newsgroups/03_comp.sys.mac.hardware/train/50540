sound about right.

if there is high demand for a product there is littl incent to
aggres cut price.  onc the demand fall off a bit, then is the
time to start get aggress with price.  wait too long can
realli hurt your busi though :-)

the powerbook have sold veri well up to now, if thei ar slow
down appl need to come out with some lower price version (the
onli reason i own a powerbook is that i could spring for a $900 pb100,
the rest of the lineup is wai to pricei for me).  i'd bet thei'll
be come out with more power version too.
