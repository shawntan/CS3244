i have read on report of a brave soul who rewir the 40 mhz clock and a higher
speed clock oscil's output through a doubl throw switch to allow differ
 speed. there wa no mention of ani attempt to switch speed on the fly but
if the si us time loop anyth like a quadra for access it floppi
drive, dynam switch will wreak havoc. a quadra must reboot after have it
clock speed significantli chang or it will be unabl to properli access it
floppi drive.
