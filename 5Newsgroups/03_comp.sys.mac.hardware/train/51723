after compar the abov string with my at command refer guid, i
came up with:
atz0l2n2x5&d0s11=50^m
thi is enter in the 'initi' box on the 'modem prefer' in zterm.
quick summari of each commmand:
z0	- reset modem to user profil 0.
l2	- speaker volum at 2 (fairli quiet)
n2	- ring volum at 2 (fairli quiet)
x5	- displai connect info accord to set 5 (see manual)
&d0	- assum dtr (comput) is alwai on
s11=50	- dial speed at 50 (as fast as zyxel can handl)

in firstclass, i us thi same string, with the addit of s0=0 right
befor the s11 command, in the setup box.  thi disabl the auto-answer 
function of the modem for firstclass.  i base my modem set on the supra
14.4fax, and just chang the abov mention string.

in telefind, i base my set on the zoom v42 - hh set.  i chang
the 'modem initi' string to the same on i us for firstclass, and
everyth seem to work fine.

sorri it took so long to get thi summari out.  if someon want to forward
thi to the /info-mac/report directori at sumex-aim, it might save other
newbi zyxel user like myself the troubl of set up their string, and
also save the net some redund messag.  if anyon els ha someth
to add, feel free.
