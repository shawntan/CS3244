   * the soni cpd-1304 ha better video circuitri than either of the
   other two monitor.  it can displai appl 640x480, vga 640x480, vga
   800x600 (though thi ha 56 hz flicker), and appl 832x624 (75 hz
   refresh:  no flicker at all).  it might be abl to displai appl's
   1024x768, but i'm not sure about thi, and the pixel would be real
   small anywai so it might not be that us.

   note that with either soni monitor, you will need the proper adapt,
   which both connect the video signal properli, but also inform the
   macintosh video hardwar of which displai mode to us.

i'm assum that the cabl tell the mac, at startup, what kind of
monitor is connect.  now i think i've seen ad in popular mac
magazin for product (i'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a
video card, or a packag of both) that allow you to chang resolut
on the fly (w/o restart the mac).

if you were to bui a 1304, would it be possibl to switch back and
forth between appl 640x480 and appl 832x624 without restart the
mac?  is thi strictli a hardwar startup function, or can softwar
interven, or doe the mac hardwar occasion probe the cabl
set and switch automat?

thank,
