i'm consid bui on of these to offload the intern video
in my iici and to get 24 bit color capabl on my 13" monitor. what's
the deal on them?

1) do thei come with vari amount of ram? if so, what is the max
and min? how much do i need for 640 x 480 x 24 bit?

2) what bit depth ar support? on, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?

3) ar all these card acceler or just some? is it true that
modern acceler video card ar (at least in gener) faster? what
bit depth ar acceler, all or just 24 bit? i've heard that some
applic actual run *slower* with thi card if thei write directli
to the screen (or someth like that). is thi a frequent problem?
how much slower is it?

4) didn't i read (when system 7 first came out) that the card wa
incompat? if so, how wa thi correct (finder patch, some init,
or other)? ha it been kept compat with 7.1? ar there mani other
app that it is incompat with (game or import (i.e., non-
microsloth) app, for exampl)?

5) if you have a strong opinion on it's valu for someon in my posit,
let me know what you think a reason price is to pai for it.

thank a lot for you input.
