i have the a cd-technolog drive with the toshiba mechan, and it is
supposedli the fast and best now.  it ha an access of 200ms and a data
transfer rate 300kb/sec.  it is multisess photo-cd compat.  it is
avail from educorp for $599, the cd-technolog on, and come with two
mail in coupon for two free cd.  i'm not sure if the cd's ar good, sinc
i've onli had the drive a littl less than a month and had the cd's ship
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  the
cd-technolog drive ha a separ power suppli separ from the drive,
which supposedli give it a longer life, and keep it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust.  a toshiba brand drive is also avail, but i think the
cd-technolog is better, sinc you get the same mechan, and at a slightli
lower price with two free cd.

the appl 300/330i drive, soni mechan, is around a 300ms access time i
think, and a data transfer rate of 300kb/sec.  i know it is the slowest of the
three mention here.  it is not wide avail, except through the appl
catalog, which is bad at a price of onli $599.  it is also multi-session photo
cd compat. i think the extern model come with 7 free cd, some of
which ar pretti good.

the nec drive ha been out the longest.  it ha an access time of 280ms and
a data transfer rate of 300kb/sec.  it is avail from mani vendor around
$600 dollar, includ educorp.  it wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compat
befor, but i hear that the current version that is ship is.  owner of
the older drive can get an upgrad.  it doe not come with ani free cd's
unless you bui it in a bundl.

of the three cd-rom drive abov, i think the best choic would be the
appl drive and the cd-technolog(toshiba) drive.  the appl drive for it's
compat with appl product and the cd-technolog(toshiba) for it's
speed and perform. 

btw, the model of the drive ar:

appl: applecd 300 or applecd 300i (intern)

cd-technolog:  cd-t3401 (the toshiba brand name model i'm not sure, but it
is also someth like with 3401)

nec:  cdr-74


i'm veri happi with my drive.  and have had no compat problem
whatsoev.  if i am wrong about ani of the abov, do correct me, but i am
pretti sure of myself, even when i think i'm not.

also, some of you out there might notic that i have the same last name as
the presid of cd-technolog which happen to be in southern california,
my hometown.  howev, i am not a rel nor do i know the gui.  liu is
just a common chines name, especi in southern california, with the
enorm chines commun.  besid, on of my doctor in california ha
three steve liu's as patient and anoth steve liu come to my school and
live in the next dorm.  thi is to show that liu is veri common.

steve :-)
