060 fastest, then pentium, with the first version of the powerpc
somewher in the vicin.

no.  comput speed is onli partli depend of processor/clock speed.
memori system speed plai a larg role as doe video system speed and
i/o speed.  as processor clock rate go up, the speed of the memori
system becom the greatest factor in the overal system speed.  if
you have a 50mhz processor, it can be read anoth word from memori
everi 20ns.  sure, you can put all 20ns memori in your comput, but
it will cost 10 time as much as the slower 80ns simm.

and roughli, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the 68030.
