the logitech scanman 32 is a nice unit, compact and effect it will
bring in graphic with surprisingli good qualiti. note that it effect
resolut in grei scale mode is onli about 72 dpi. if you don't intend
to magnifi a graphic, it work fine. a true 256 level grai scanner would
work better for imag.

i've seen the scanman go for as littl as $100 us. it is a reason bui
at that price. higher end hand scanner ar almost as expens as us
flat bed scanner. here is seattl, the paper show occasion good bargain
in the classifi. us color flat bed have been seen as low as $500 late.
grei scale flatb come in around $300-$350.
