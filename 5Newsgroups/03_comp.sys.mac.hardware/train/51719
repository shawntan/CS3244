sorri if thi is a faq.  i don't normal read comp.sy.mac.hardwar.
i am purchas a coupl of centri 650's.  i configur the system
as follow:

	eight (8) mb ram
	ethernet
	1 mb vram
	math coprocessor option

my purchas agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent
me the appl summari document to prove it.  i order the coprocessor
option, but i'm realli not sure that we need it.  i thought the '040 chip
had a math coprocessor built into it.  ha appl had a math coprocessor chip
architectur to keep up with the speed of the '040 chip in the centri 650?
i am concern that i mai have set up a hardwar bottleneck.  pleas send your
respons to:  david_anthoni_guevara@cup.portal.com.  i will summar if there
is enough interest.  thank!
