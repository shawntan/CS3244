i think the other repli sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive
on it side.  the point is thi will onli be sure to work on the 'new'
drive, name 1/3 ht lp drive that have a smaller platter and ar also
more stabl.
	why should i take the chanc?  becaus i've been run a maxtor 1/3 ht
120 lp on both it side and flat for about a year and i've had no
problem with it.  period.
	like i alwai sai, never trust the manufactur.
