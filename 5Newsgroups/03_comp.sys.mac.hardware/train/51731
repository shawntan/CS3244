hi there,

doe anyon know why appl ha an ambigu messag for
c650 regard fpu?  in all mac price list i've seen, everi c650
ha the messag "fpu: option".  i know from what we've discuss in thi
newsgroup that all c650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80
configur.  why would thei be so unclear about thi issu in their
price list?
i'm plan to bui the c650 8/230/cd pretti soon, but i'm now get
confus with whether it come with fpu or not.
why sai "option" if it's built in?
pleas, anybodi help me understand thi game.

regard,

thian.
