i have the same problem and wa about to post thi....

hello duo owner (and appl technic peopl :-)
 
i have a new duo 230 which appear to have a problem wake up from
sleep when run on batteri power. when woken (usual for the second
time) after sleep, the wake fail and the screen appear with a
corrupt imag of broken horizont line and control can onli be
recov with control-command-poweron or the reset kei at the back of
the machin. the problem occur even when the system is stock standard
(no extens, no virtual memori, a fulli charg new batteri, system 7.1
etc). i have not had the problem when the machin is plug in to ac.
i've check that the batteri is properli seat (it appear to be fine).
 
what's go on here ? anyon els had thi problem ? is it softwar or
hardwar ? 
 
if you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedli sleep and
wake the machin on batteri power and let me know if you see the same
behaviour (and let appl know too !).
 
mani thank to anyon who can clear thi on up for me.
 
bruce
