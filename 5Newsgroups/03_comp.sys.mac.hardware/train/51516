it would depend on the requir of the poster's data, for some
purpos 1/256 resolut (with or without calibr curv).


otherwis the other possibl would be:

1) get a digit voltamet with serial output & connect to serial
port on mac, collect data with some commun program.

2) bui an a/d chip from analog devic, burr-brown, etc, connect to
a parallel to serial convert, us serial port for acquisit
(nah. too much solder and troubl shoot :-)

3) get a board from nation instrument, data translat, omega,
etal.  the finest solut, but possibl the most costli.



to the origin poster:  if the signal is too larg, why not
us a voltag divid? two resistor, cost veri cheap...
