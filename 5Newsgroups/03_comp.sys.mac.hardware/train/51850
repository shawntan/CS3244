i've recent order a centri 650 and need to decid on which modem to
bui.  i'm pretti sure i want to get a fax/data modem that can run at 14.4k,
but is it worth it?  i'll primarili onli be 'convers' over compuserv or
some other link to the internet, but i'm not sure if those system can
suppli me with data at 14.4k.  anoth question i have is in some of the
modem lingo out there.  i understand baud rate, but what doe v3.4 and
v3.4bi mean?  i could realli us some suggest as to what a good modem
for around $300 would be, and why it would be a good choic.

thank for your time.
