i just recent bought a 4 mb ram card for my origin mac portabl 
(backlit) and have sinc had some bizarr crash. it happen when i put 
the machin to sleep and wake the machin up. sometim it will just 
freez the cursor and lock the machin up forc me to push the reset 
switch. other time it will give me the usual bomb box with the error 
messag of "co processor not instal". 

i know on solut is not to put the machin to sleep, but doe anyon 
have ani idea on what could be caus thi or better yet what might fix 
it? the memori card is psuedostat ram and goe into the pd slot. that 
probabl figur into the problem. the manufactur is king memori (not 
kingston) from irvin, ca. thei sai the problem is in my machin. 

ani idea? -- gene wright.
