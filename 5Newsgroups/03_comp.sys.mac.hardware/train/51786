i think you will find that the mac se can print grayscal imag, load
with the proper softwar. howev, the mac se cannot displai grayscal on
it screen or ani attach video becaus that abil is not in the rom.

so, while you might be abl to print grayscal, you'd have a hard time
see the grayscal imag you want to print.
