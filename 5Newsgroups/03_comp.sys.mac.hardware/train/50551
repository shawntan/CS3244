hi, i have been get a lot of request for thi inform so i thought
i would post it for those interest parti. (sorri for length).

to increas the maciisi speed to 25mhz or 33mhz the clock must be chang
from 40mhz to 50mhz or 64mhz respect.
thi is done by go to a static-free work station or put some
aluminum foil down to work on.
	1. open up the si by lift the tab at the back of the case.
	2. remov the hard disk by disconnect the power and scsi cabl,
		spread the tab, and lift the drive out.
	3. remov the flopi drive.
	4. remov the power suppli by spread the tab in front and lift
		the suppli straight up and out.
	5. remov the fan by press the ear togeth at the back, bottom
		side of the fan and lift straight up and out.
	6. remov the mother board by spread the tab on the left and
		right side of the board and slide the board forward then
		lift the board out. (all connector on the back of the
		board must be remov first)
	7. desold the 40mhz clock (the on closest to the memori modul).
		thi is not easi even for a skill solder.
	8. get an ic socket with the round pin and remov four of the pin
		by push them up from the bottom with long nose plier.
	9. put the four pin in the hole vacat by the clock and solder 
		them in.
	10.insert a 50mhz or 64mhz clock.
	11.put larg power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 
		the other larg chip just to the right of the processor and
		figur some wai to hold the heat sync's in place. i made a
		simpl clamp by put a four inch screw up through the hole
		in the board between the two chip. mount the screw us
		insul washer. screw a cross member down over the heat
		sync's to hold them in place. don't us too much pressur.

	12. put it all back togeth and go-for-it.

disclaim: thi is onli the procedur i us and is not author by anyon.
	    you ar on your own for thi procedur. i'm quit sure it will
	    void your warente.

bye for now,
