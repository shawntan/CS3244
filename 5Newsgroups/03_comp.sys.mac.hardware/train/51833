the problem mention last is a known quadra scsi problem, it wa heavili
discuss last year and an appl employe point out that there wa a
on byte error in the scsi driver routin for the quadra's (at least the
700
and 900).  system 7.1 should not have that problem, for most peopl the 
solut wa to get an updat driver from the drive manufactor.  in my
case mass microsystem wrote a new driver which fix the problem on my
quadra
700, all that occur earli last year.
