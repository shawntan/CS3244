i have an old mac plu. a coupl of year ago i bought a shinei new lc.
it came with appl's new keyboard (with abd port). i replac it with
a mac-pro-plu extend keyboard (which i thoroughli enjoi, thank you
veri much).
 
well, i have thi extra keyboard which i would like to us on the plu
but there's a littl problem. the plu us an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboard don't. i got an extra adb cabl from my
local appl dealer (thei're such nice peopl), but thei couldn't tell
me the order of the wire.
 
there ar four wire in the adb cabl: black, white, red, tan. i know
on's a ground, on get the serial signal, on suppli 5 volt, and
i forgot what the fourth on doe. anywai, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <realli> don't want to do <that>.
 
if ani brave soul out there have done thi befor, pleas e-mail your
experi directli to me. i would greatli appreci it especi
sinc appl's origin keyboard is not . . . ergonom correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correl between the wire for the rj-11 jack and the adb sinc it
ha both, but no such luck (the connect ar solder insid of
littl box). oh, well . . .
