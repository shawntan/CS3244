try look at the brainstorm acceler for the plu.  i believ it is
the best solut becaus of the perform and price.  why spend $800
upgrad a comput that is onli worth $300 ????
  the brainstorm acceler is around $225.  it speed up the intern
clock speed to 16mhz.  that mai not seem like much but it also speed up
scsi transfer.  i think that featur is uniqu to brainstorm.
check it out.
