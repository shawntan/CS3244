  i have a radiu precis color 24x video card for the mac that fit in a 
nubu slot.  the card ha 3 mb of vram on it, which mean that 24-bit color 
is possibl on the card!  the card support just about ani monitor scan
rate you can think of (i us it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it
can go higher).  you can switch resolut and depth on the fly with a
softwar control panel.

  thi is the acceler version of the card, which mean all quickdraw 
call ar not execut by the cpu but taken over by the video card, free
up the mac processor for other task. 

  the cheapest i could find thi card for when i call around last night
wa $1738 at mac's place.  i will sell it for $1250 + ship.  it is just
over a year old and never been ani problem.  it come with softwar and the
origin manual.

  hurri!
