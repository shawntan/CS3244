when appl came with their demo to iowa state, i got a chanc to run
speedomet3.1 on some of the new mac.  both machin were run
system7.1, had a 14" rgb.  don't know what the cach were set to.
neither machin had an fpu  it appear that the centri610 is quit a
bit faster than the lc iii:

		centri610		lciii

cpu		13.01			6.92
graf		15.67			7.69
disk		2.22			2.44
math		25.57			10.19

p.r. rate	12.91			6.58

so, there is a comparison.  there is definit a veri notic speed
differ between these two machin accord to speedomet3.1.
