	hello,

	i rememb run across an ad in the back of mac[user|world]
a few year ago, for a nubu board that had umpteen simm slot, to be
us to "recycl your old simm," when you upgrad memori.  i don't
rememb who made thi board, and i haven't seen it advertis in
ani of the latest mac magazin.  it mention that it includ softwar
to make the simm on the board act like a ram disk. as someon who ha simm 
he can't get rid of/us, but hate the wast, thi sound to me like a majorli
good idea.  doe anyon out there know what board/compani i'm talk about?  
ar thei still in busi, or doe anyon know where i can get a us on
if thei ar no longer made?  ani help would be greatli appreci.  pleas
e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth.


	thank,

	cap.
