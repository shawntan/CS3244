final got my comput fix and i'd like to sum up.

about hard drive compani: the origin 160 meg drive that wa bad (bad
sector or someth) wa an ibm.  the new on is a quantum.  is the lciii
suppos to be ship with ibm?  is there a qualiti differ? 
appar! :)

second, about hard drive posit.  i've put the lciii on it side and
the new 160 hd ha had no problem at all.  i've even switch back and
forth between horizont and vertic and there ar no problem.  as far
as i'm concern i don't believ hd posit is import for drive up
to 160 meg, in ani comput.  don't know about cd-rom, though.
