you'll probabl have to set the palett up befor you try draw
in the new colour.

us the bio interrupt call to set the r g & b valu (in the rang
from 0-63 for most card) for a particular palett colour (in the
rang from 0-255 for 256 colour mode).

then you should be abl to draw pixel in those palett valu and
the result should be ok.

you might have to do a bit of colourmap compress if you have
more than 256 uniqu rgb triplet, for a 256 colour mode.
