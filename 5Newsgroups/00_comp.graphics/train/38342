hi.  i'm write a program to convert .dxf file to a databas
format us by a 3d graphic program i've written.  my program store
the point of a polygon in ccw order.  i've us 3d concept a 
littl and it seem that the point ar store in the order
thei ar drawn.

doe the dxf format have a wai of indic which order the 
point ar store in, cw or ccw?  it easi enough to convert,
but if i don't know which wai thei ar store, i dont know 
which direct the polygon should be visibl from.

if dxf doesn't handl thi, can anyon recommend a workaround?
the best i can think of is to creat two polygon for each on
in the dxf file, on store cw and the other ccw.  but that
doubl the number of polygon and decreas speed...

thank in advanc for ani help,
