   concern the propos newsgroup split, i person am not in favor of
   do thi.  i learn an aw lot about all aspect of graphic by read
   thi group, from code to hardwar to algorithm.  i just think make 5
   differ group out of thi is a wate, and will onli result in a few post
   a week per group.  i kind of like the conveni of have on big forum
   for discuss all aspect of graphic.  anyon els feel thi wai?
   just curiou.

i disagre.  you could learn the same amount by read all the
split group, and it would make thing easier for those of us
who ar less omnivor.  there is no "wast" in creat new
group -- it just a bit of shuffl about.  i have no problem
with onli a few post per week per group - i spend too much time
on thi as it is.
