i am look for some inform of hidden line remov us robert
algorithm.  someth with code, or pseudo code would be especi
help.

i am requir to do thi for a class, due mondai (we have veri littl
time to implement these chang, it is a veri fast pace class).  the
note given in class leav a lot to be desir, so i would vastli
appreci ani help.

actual ani algorithm would be nice (robert or no).  the main problem
is two object intersect in x and y dimens, need to know which
line to clip off so that on object will appear in front of anoth.

if you can give me an ftp address and filenam, or even the name of a
good book, i'd realli appreci it.

thank,
brian raynor
