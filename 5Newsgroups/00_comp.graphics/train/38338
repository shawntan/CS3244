hi to all out there.  we have thi problem, and i'm not certain i'm solv it
in the correct wai.  i wa wonder if anyon can shed light on thi, or point
me in the right place to look...

we have an x-rai imag camera and a metal tube with a cylindr hole
pass through it at a right angl to the tube's axi:

                                                          |
                                     ||                   [ imag
                                                          |
  x-rai sourc ]                     ||                   | screen
                            metal || tube              |
                                     ||                   |
                                                          |

we know sourc--screen centr distanc, radiu of the tube, radiu of the hole.

we do some calcul base on the imag of the hole on the screen.  howev,
the calcul ar mathemat highli complex, and must assum that the
object's hole project an imag (resembl an ellips if the tube is not
parallel to the screen) in the centr of the screen.  howev, it is unlik
that the object is place so conveni.  

firstli, we must transform the major and minor axi of the ellips.  i cannot
know what the angl between the tube and screen is.  do i have to assum that
thei ar parallel to do the transform?  how do i do thi transform?

secondli, there is a distort of the imag due to the screen be planar
(the sourc--screen distanc increas as we move awai from the centr of the
screen).  how can i compens the ellips's axi for thi imag distort?

so, pleas can anyon give us a few pointer here?  how do we transform the
imag so it appear as it would if it were in the centr of the screen, and how
do i deal with distort due to the shape of the screen?

we'd appreci ani help, either post or email.

thank in advanc, simon.
