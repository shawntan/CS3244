i am write some utili to convert regi and tekton esacp sequenc  
into some us format. i would rather not have to goto a bitmap format.  
i can convert them to window meta file easili enough, but i would rather  
convert them to corel draw, .cdr, or ms power point, .ppt, file.  
microsoft would not give me the format. i wa wonder if anybodi out  
there know the format for these two applic.
