                     pratic imag process in c
                     by craig a. lindlei
                     publish by wilei

it address read/write to/from pcx/tiff file; imag acquisit, 
manipul and storag; and ha sourc code in the book. the sourc is 
primarili written in turbo c and natur ha convers possibl. i 
have convert some of it to quick c. natur, the code ha some problem 
in the book - as usual. typo, syntax, etc. ar problem. it can be a good 
learn experi for someon who is studi c. there is also a companion 
disk with sourc avail for order and $50.00. overal, the book is not 
bad. i acquir the book at waldensoftwar.
