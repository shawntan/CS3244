i'm work upon a game us an isometr perspect, similar to
that us in popul.  basic, you look into a room that look
similar to the follow:

                             xxxx
                         xxxxx   xxxx
                     xxxx    x       xxxx
                 xxxx        x           xxxx
             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx
             x           xxxx    xxxx           x
             x       xxxx            xxxx       x
             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x
             xxxx              3 /|\         xxxx
                 xxxx            /~\     xxxx
                     xxxx            xxxx
                         xxxx    xxxx
                             xxxx

the good thing about thi perspect is that you can look and move
around in three dimens and still maintain your peripher vision. [*]

sinc your viewpoint is alwai the same, the routin can be hard-code
for a particular vantag.  in my case, wall two's rise edg ha a slope
of 1/4. (i'm also us mode x, 320x240).

i've run into two problem; i'm sure that other reader have tri thi
befor, and have perhap formul their own opinion:

1) the routin for draw wall 1 & 2 were trivial, but when i ran a
pack->planar imag through them, i wa dismai by the "jaggi."  i'm
now consid some anti-alias routin (speed is not realli necessari).
is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall alreadi skew,
thu be assur of nice imag, or is thi too much of a burden?

2) wall 3 present a problem; the algorithm i us tend to overli distort
the origin.  i tri to decid on paper what pixel go where, and fail.
ha anyon come up with method for map a planar to crosswis shear
shape?

current i take:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64

and produc:
            
             1  2  3  4
33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8
49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12
            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16
                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32
                                    61 62 63 64

line 1 follow the slope.  line 2 is directli under line 1.
line 3 move up a line and left 4 pixel.  line 4 is under line 3.
thi fill the shape exactli without ani unfil pixel.  but
it caus distort.  ha anyon come up with a better wai?
perhap it is necessari to simpli draw the origin bitmap
alreadi skew?

ar there ani other particularli sticki problem with thi perspect?
i wa plan on have hidden plane remov by us z-buffer.
locat ar store in (x,y,z) form.

[*] for those of you who notic, the top line of wall 2 (and wall 1)
*ar* parallel with it bottom line.  thi is why there appear to
be an optic illus (ie. it appear to be either the insid or outsid
of a cube, depend on your mood).  there ar no vanish point.
thi simplifi the draw code for object (which don't have to
chang size as thei move about in the room).  i've decid that thi
approxim is alright, sinc small displac at a larg enough
distanc caus veri littl chang in the appar size of an object in
a real perspect draw.

hopefulli the "context" of the pictur (ie. chair on the floor, torch
hang on the wall) will dispel ani visual ambigu.

thank in advanc for ani help.
