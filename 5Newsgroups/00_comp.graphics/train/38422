find the circumcent of a tetrahedron is discuss on page 33 in

contour: a guid to the analysi and displai of spatial data,
by dave watson, pergamon press,  1992, isbn 0 08 040286 0, 321p.

each pair of tetrahedr vertic defin a plane which is a 
perpendicular bisector of the line between that pair.  express each
plane in the form ax + by + cz = d
and solv the set of simultan equat from ani three of those
plane that have a vertex in common (all vertic ar us).  
the solut is the circumcent.
