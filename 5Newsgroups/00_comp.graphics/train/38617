ye, but... shouldn't size of newsgroup be an issu?  sorri if thi
ha been cover befor, but comp.grahpic.anim get how much 
traffic per dai?  50 articl?  mayb 70 on an extrem heavi dai?
i've been follow thi group for about four month now, and i don't
recal ever see such a flood of post that a split would be warrant.

just my 2 cent,
