    i bought the diamond stealth 24 a few month ago.  it seem to be a
great card especi with my multimedia present.  it run graphic
and anim as well as some near full motion video veri well.  the onli
thing i can tell that it lack is speed abov 256 color.  it qualit in
between 256 and 16.7 million collor un unreal but you definitli
compromis speed.  it seem to be a great card for graphic and it come
with some great softwar, but im not so sure about the exceler
part.  i us to own a paridis and it doesnt seem to be much faster
than that.  on thing i do like is that it load it own vesa driver
from rom at startup, (i think) becaus i have never had to load it for
link386 or ani other program that requir special vesa driver at
startup.
