i think you ar too optimist! postscript is a veri big languag and
so the fig format can not be abl to be an interpret of ani arbitrari
ps code. the onli program i know to manipul postscript file is
islanddraw.
i for myself us xfig and includ the postscript file (convert to
epsi format). small chang then ar possibl (eras some letter,
ad text and so on).
