hi,

  i'm look for an algorithm that would gener a good cross-section of
rgb colour given a limit colour map size. 

the problem: i'm write an applic for the pc that mai have at most 256
color. i want to us on colormap (palett) for the applic but i'd like
it to contain an even spread of colour of the visibl spectrum. i could us 
a 6x6x6 rgb cube but the problem is that a lot of those colour ar almost
ident to the human ey. 

doe anyon know how i can optim my choic of color ?
