by '8 grei level imag' you mean 8 item of 1bit imag?
it doe work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit
in your screen and if the screen intens is non-linear.

with 2 bit per pixel; there could be 1*c_1 + 4*c_2 time,
thi give 16 level, but thei ar linear if screen intens is
linear.
with 1*c_1 + 2*c_2 it work, but we have to find the best
compin -- there's 10 level, but 16 chois; best 10 must be
chosen. differ compin for the same level, vari a bit, but
the level keep their order.

reader should verifi what i wrote... :-)
