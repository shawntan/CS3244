basic, there ar two algorithm determin whether a point is insid,
outsid or on the polygon. the first on is rai (or half line) method. in
thi method, you can draw ani rai, if the number of the intersect point
of the rai and the polygon is even, then it is outsid. if the number is odd,
then it is insid. of caus, you have to deal with the special case which
mai make you headach.

the second method is pi algorithm. draw the line between the point and
all the vertic on the polygon. calcul and sum the angl of the
success line. if the result is 2*pi, then it is insid. if pi, then
it is on the polygon. otherwis it is outsid.

my experi tell the second method is relibl.

hope thi help.
