thi past week i've been plai with some of the r-d (reaction-
diffus, not to be confus with rd or r&d) techniqu
from siggraph '91.

i wa wonder what materi is avail to explain the control
mechan a littl more.  it seem to me veri much like a matter of
pick random magic number and sit back and wait.  although
both of the paper (turk and witkin & kass) were veri well organ
and extrem help, i guess what i need is a more basic descript
of the techniqu, especi wrt the control mechan.  the test
that i did had a tendenc to either turn into blurri mud or becom
unstabl.

is there ani info avail onlin?  sourc code would be great but
not necessari.

thank!
