ye i am awar coreldraw export in scodal.
version 2 did it quit well, apart from a
few hassl with radial fill. version 3 revb
is better but if you try to export in scodal
with a bitmap imag includ in the draw
it will sai someth like "cannot export
scodal with bitmap"- at least it doe on my
version.
 if anyon out there know a wai around thi
i am all ear.
 tempor imag make a product call filmpak
which convert autocad plot to scodal, postscript
to scodal and now gif to scodal but it cost $650
and i wa just wonder if there wa anyth out
there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad
cheaper.
