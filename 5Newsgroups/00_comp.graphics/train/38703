speak of psygnosi, thei have licens game to philip inter
media intern for cd-i.

the multimedia forum.

"seventh guest ha been licens by virgin game to philip interact
media intern for worldwid cd-i right. were also licens to
p.i.m.i. litil divil from gremlin graphic (uk) and microcosm from
psygnosi (uk). those three titl will be adapt on cd-i us the full
potenti of the fmv cartridg, mean, us the addit memori as
well as the motion video capabl. those titl have been negoci
in europ but will be avail worldwid.

soccer from rage (uk)."

i don't know when these titl will be avail or when work on them even
