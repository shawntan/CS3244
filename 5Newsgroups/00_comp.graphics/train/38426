i plan to post a summari of respons to thi as soon as i have work
code, which i will also includ.  the intersect of 3 plane method
look best, but my implement base on a short articl in 
graphic gem i doesn't work.  i mai be misinterpret, of cours.

i had avoid the simultan solut of the plane equat in favor
of dot and cross product, but the former mai actual be better.  in either
case a matrix determin need to be comput (implicitli in the solut
of linear equat).

to get the plane, i wa take the midpoint of the line from, sai,
p1 to p2, and set the normal as the "normal" vector from p1 to p2.
these just plug into the formula in graphic gem.  howev, the result
center point is onli occasion equidist from all 4 of my test point
(for differ test).  my matrix/vector math is veri rusti, but it look like
i need to verifi the formula, or us the simultan equat solut, which
will requir bring in anoth routin i don't have (but should be easi to
find).

anoth method is to first find the center of the circl defin by 2 set
of 3 point, and intersect the normal from there.  thi would also defin
the circl center.  howev, small numer imprecis would make the
line not intersect.  supposedli 3 plane have to intersect in a uniqu
point if thei ar not parallel.

thank to all who answer so far.
