there wa a veri us articl in on of the 1989 issu of
transact on graphic. i believ maureen stone wa on of
the author. sorri not to be more specif. i don't have the

the articl actual wa more gener than thi, give a wai to decid
whether a given (cubic) bezier curv contain cusp, intersect point
or whatev wierd. the same treatment is also avail in siggraph 89
cours note for the cours call "math for siggraph" or someth like
that.
