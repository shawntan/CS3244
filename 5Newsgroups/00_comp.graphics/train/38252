garbo.uwasa.fi (or on of it mani mirror) ha a file
call "svgabg40" in the program subdirectori.
these ar svga bgi driver for a varieti of card.

[from the readm]:
"card type support: (supervga driver)
  ahead, ati, chip & tech, everex, genoa, paradis, oak, trident (both 8800 
  and 8900, 9000), tseng (both 3000 and 4000 chipset) and video7.
  these driver will also work on video card with vesa capabl.
  the tweak driver will work on ani regist-compat vga card."
