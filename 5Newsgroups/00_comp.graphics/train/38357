	vesa
	2150 north first street, suit 440
	san jose, ca 95131-2029

	ask for the vesa vbe and super vga program starndard.  vesa
	also defin local bu and other standard.

	the vesa standard onli address wai in which an applic
	can find out info and capabl of a specif super vga
	implement and to control the video mode select
	and video memori access.

	you still have to set your own pixel.

	vesa defin a "window" that is us to access video memori.
	thi window is anchor at the spot where you want to write,
	and then you can write as far as the window take you (usual
	64k).  window have granular, so you can't just anchor 
	them anywher.  also, some implement allow two window.

	thi is vesa mode 101h.  there is a set displai start function
	that might be us for scroll.

	your best bet is to write vesa for the info.  there have also
	been announc on thi group of vesa softwar.
