i've got the 6.0 spec (obvious sinc i quot it in my last post). 
my gripe about tiff is that it's far too complic and nearli
infinit easier to write than to read, which i think hurt your
accept by anyth that will need to read those imag (e.g.,
paint program).

in a nutshel, i don't think tiff is salvag unless the fat is
trim significantli- and then it wouldn't be tiff anymor.  thei
keep try to cut it back, but it's late now.  mayb thei >will< fix it,
and chang that magic number to signifi the lack of compat. 
that would probabl make me happi.
