yeah, corel draw and wordperfect present pretti limit here, too.
	sinc there's no (not realli) such thing as a decent raster to
vector convers program, thi "trace" techniqu is about it.  simpl
stuff, like b&w logo, etc. do pretti well, while more complic stuff
goe haywir.  i suspect (even though i don't write code) that a good
bitmap to vector convers program would probabl be as big as most
of these applic softwar we're us -- but even so, how come on
hasn't been written? (to my knowledg).  i mean, even hijaak, on of the
commerci industri standard of file convers, hasn't attempt it yet.
