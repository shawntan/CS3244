i am current look for a 3d graphic librari that run on ms
window 3.1.  ar there ani such librari out there other than
visuallib?  (it must run on vga and should not requir ani other
add-on graphic card).

for visuallib, will it run with metawar high c compil v3.0?  ani
email contact for the author of visuallib?
