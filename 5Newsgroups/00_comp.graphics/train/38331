a veri kind soul ha mail me thi repli for the bug in cview.
sinc he isn't in the posit to post thi himself, he ask me to post
it for him, but to leav hi name out. so here it come:

cview ha quit a number of bug.  the on you mention is perhap the most
annoi, but not the most danger.  as far as i can determin, it ha to
do with the temp file that cview creat.  cview give the user no control
over where it place it temp file: it just place them in it
"current directori".  the problem you mention occur (as far as i can tell)
when it run out of disk space for it temp file. it seem as if cview
doesn't check properli for thi situat.  as cview decod a jpeg, it seem 
to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour
inform. then, for 8 bit displai, it doe the "dither", again write
anoth file with the 8 bit colour inform.  while it is write thi
second file, it also write the data to your colour card. then when it doe
the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopi all the data from the 8 bit file to
your screen again.  (it doe thi last "recopi" oper for it
"fit to screen" featur, even when thi featur is not enabl.)

 the result of thi process is the follow:
  
     1) if it run out of disk space when write the first 24 bit file, all
        you ever see is as much data as it ha room for, and the last bit of
        data is simpli repeat over and over again becaus cview never
        realiz the disk ha fill up and disk write/read aren't perform.

     2) if it ha enough room for the 24 bit data, but run out of room for
        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the pictur as it doe the
        dither and write to the screen card.
        howev, then when it finish the dither and recopi the data
        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatev reason it doe thi)
        on again just get a repetit of the last chunk of data for which
        there wa room on the disk.

thi is just a guess, but probabl fairli accur.  at least the gener
idea is on track i think, although i have probabl made error in detail
about file i/o etc.  the wai around thi is  of cours to clear up suffici
disk space.  the temp file for larg jpeg's (1200x900 and bigger) can be
veri larg (3 meg + 1 meg ).  on some of the largest i have need in excess
of 6 meg free disk space.


cview ha a much more seriou bug: if you ar try to displai a file from
a floppi, and you chang floppi while cview ha some temp file open on the
floppi, then cview in certain circumst will write the directori (and fat
tabl? i can't rememb) for the remov floppi onto the newli insert
floppi, thu corruptimg the new floppi in a veri seriou, possibl
unrevcover wai.  so be care!  it is incred poor program for a
program to do thi.  on the other hand, when choos file in the open file
menu, cview insist on do a few disk read everi time on move the
hi-lighter squar.  incred annoi when it could do them all at onc
when it get the directori info.  and realli, how much effort doe it take to
sort a directori list?


with much thank to the origin of thi articl.
