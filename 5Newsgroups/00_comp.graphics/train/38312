sketch:  rotat so cylind axi is || z axi.

intersect x/y project of line with project cylind (similar to,
but easier than, sphere intersect).  result: no intersect, on
intersect, or two intersect, parameter along line by t0 and
t1.  now look at z, and comput intersect of line with top and
bottom plane of cylind.  thi give t0' and t1'.  the interv of
intersect is then the bit of the line from [t0,t1] intersect [t0',t1'].

detail left as an exercis for the reader.
