(1) no explicit (c) is necessari.  if it the imag is attribut to the
geospher compani, then there is a likelihood permiss is ha been
given to reprint.

(2) unlik that the owner can or will go after individu.
howev, "interest" imag do make their wai into ad and
comput demo. that is when a pirat might get some flak.
thi imag is consid so "interest" that mani peopl would
like to us it whenev some global map is need, so there
is lot of temptat.

(3) on mail person said sinc the sourc data- satellit imageri-
is not copyright, then the deriv imag can't be.  not true.
a new, distinct, creativ express of the data can be protect.
thi imag is certainli fit such, sinc no on els ha taken the
tremend effort to re-creat it themselv.  preced is a recent
telephon book court case.  ma bell tri to copyright the data in
their book and prevent competitor from copi it (there ar
trick entri in the book).  but the court onli permit copyright
of the express of the data, and not the data themselv. (you cant
xerox and sell the telephon book.)

(4) there will be more attent to digit copyright in the futur
and comput becom a mass product and mogul such as bill gate
ar current hoard the digit copyright.

(5) i'd prefer that geospher put thi data in the public domain becaus
it is veri interest to me and other, but that's the wai thing ar.
