what is oti?

oti is here for the purpos of distribut origin artwork
and photograph over the network for public perus, scrutini,    
and distribut.  digit immort.

the basic idea behind "digit immort" is that comput network   
ar here to stai and that anyth interest you deposit on them
will be around near-forev.  the gif and jpg of todai will be the
artifact of a digit futur.  perhap thei'll be put in differ
format, perhap onli surviv on backup tape....but thei'll be
there...and someon will dig them up.  
 
if that doesn't interest you... oti also offer a forum for critiqu
and exhibit of your work....a virtual art galleri that never close
and exist in an inform dimens where your submiss will hang
as wallpap on thousand of glow monitor.  suddenli, life is 
breath into your work...and by merit of it's stimulu, it will 
travel the globe on puls of light and electron.
 
spectat ar welcom also, feel free to brows the galleri and 
let the artist know what you think of their effort.  keep your own
copi of the imag to look at when you've got the gumption...
that's what thei're here for.

how do you contribut?
              
what happen is...you draw a pretti pictur or take a love   
photo, get it scan into an imag file, then either ftp-put
it in the contrib/incom directori or us uuencod to send it to me
(email address at eof) in email.  after the imag is receiv,
it will be put into the correct directori.  comput origin work
ar also welcom.

oti' directori hous two type of imag file, gif and jpg.  
gif and jpg file requir, oddli enough, a gif or jpg viewer to 
see.  these viewer ar avail for all type of comput at 
most larg ftp site around internet.  jpg viewer ar a bit
tougher to find.  if you can't find on, but do have a gif viewer,  
you can obtain a jpg-to-gif convers program which will chang    
jpg file to a standard gif format. 

oti also accept anim file.      

when you submit imag file, pleas send me email at the same time
state inform about what you upload and whether it is to be
us (in public or other project) or if it is mere for peopl
to view.  also, includ some biograph inform on yourself, we'll
be have info-file on each contribut artist and their work.  you 
can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of 
email).

if you have pictur, but no scanner, there is hope.  mere send
copi to:

the oti project
c/o ed stastni
po bx 241113
omaha, ne 68124-1113

i will either scan them myself or get them to someon who will  
scan them.  includ an ampl sase if you want your stuff back.  
also includ inform on each imag, prefer a 1-3 line 
descript of the imag that we can includ in the infofil in the
directori where it's final put.  if you have prefer as to what
the imag ar to be name, includ those as well.  
 
convers, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, pleas
contact me and we'll arrang thing.

if you want to submit your work by disk, peachi.  mere send a 3.5"
disk to the abov address (omaha) and a sase if you want your disk back.
thi is good for peopl who don't have direct access to encod or ftp,
but do have access to a scanner.  we accept disk in either mac or ibm
compat format.  if possibl, pleas submit imag file as gif or
jpg.  if you can't...we can convert from most format...we'd just rather
not have to.

at sender request, we can also fill disk with as much oti as thei
can stand.  even if you don't have stuff to contribut, you can send
a blank disk and an sase (or $2.50 for disk, postag and pack) to 
get a slab-o-oti.

as of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabyt of file, and grow.  
email me for current archiv size and directori.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

distribut?

the imag distribut by the oti project mai be distribut freeli   
on the condit that the origin filenam is kept and that it is
not alter in ani wai (save to convert from on imag format to
anoth).  in fact, we encourag file to be distribut to local 
bulletin board and such.  if you could, pleas transport the
appropri text file along with the imag.  
 
it would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post imag
from oti to your local bb.  i just want to keep track of them so
particip can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.

it's the purpos of oti to get these imag spread out as much as
possibl.  if you have the time, pleas upload a few to your favorit
bb system....or even just post thi "info-file" there.  it would be
keen of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

us?

if you want to us ani of the work you find on the oti directori,
you'll have to check to see if permiss ha been grant and the 
stipul of the permiss (such as free copi of public, or
full address credit).  you will either find thi in the ".rm" file for    
the imag or seri of imag...or in the "artist" directori under the 
artist name.  if permiss isn't explicitli given, then you'll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it.  if no info is avail, email
me (ed@cwi.unomaha.edu), and i'll get in contact with the artist for 
you, or give you their contact inform.
 
when you do us permit work, it's alwai courteou to let the artist
know about it, perhap even send them a free copi or some such
compens for their file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

name imag?

pleas keep the name of your file in "do" format.  that mean, keep
the filenam (befor .jpg or .gif) to eight charact or less.  the wai
i usual do it is to us the initi of the artist, plu a three or
four digit "code" for the seri of imag, plu the seri number.
thu, leonardo devinci's fifth mechan draw would be someth
like:
 
	ldmek5.gif     or    ldmek5.jpg    or    ldmech5.gif   etc

keep the name under 8 charact assur that the filenam will
remain intact on all system.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------

when creat imag file, be sure to at least includ your name
somewher on or below the pictur.  thi give peopl a refer in
case thei'd like to contact you.  you mai also want to includ a titl,
address or other inform you'd like peopl to know.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

hmmm?!

your input is expect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

disclaim:  the oti project ha no connect to the church of oti  
 	     (a sumerian deiti) or it's follow, be thei pope, priest,
	     or ezin administr.  we do take sacrific and donat
	     howev.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

disclaim:  the oti project is here for the distribut of origin 
 	     imag file.  the file will go to the public at larg.  
	     it's possibl, as with ani form of mass-media, that someon
	     could unscrupul us your imag for financi gain.  
    	     unless you've given permiss for that, it's illeg.  oti
	     take no respons for thi.  in simpl term, all right
	     revert to the author/artist.  to leav an imag on oti is to 
	     give permiss for it to be view, copi and distribut 
	     electron.  if you don't want your imag distribut     
	     all-over, don't upload them.  to leav an imag on oti is
	     not give permiss to have it us in ani public or
	     broadcast that incur profit (thi includ, but is not 
	     limit to, magazin, newslett, clip-art softwar,        
	     screen-print cloth, etc).  you must give specif
	     permiss for thi sort of usag.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

rememb, the oper term is "stimul".  if you know of peopl
that'd be interest in thi sort of thing...get them involv...kick'm
in the booti....offer them free food...whatev...
