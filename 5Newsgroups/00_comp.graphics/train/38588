i am interest in a 2d/3d graphic librari which will allow our design
team to write graphic softwar for unix workstat and be as portabl as 
possibl.  eventu thi softwar will have to be move to microsoft
window.  it is my opinion that a good api with hook to pex underneath
would prove most portabl.

doe anyon out there have ani experi with figaro+ form tg or
hoop from ithaca softwar?  i would appreci ani comment.
