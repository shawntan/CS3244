greet,
    i have an epson hi-80 4 pen plotter forsal.  it emul an hp 7570
or 7574 - i'm not sure which.  it ha an option board on it that doe
the emul.  it ha a serial interfac with hardwar handshak. i
also have 340 pen for it as follow:  10 pack of 4 black oil base, 16
pack of 4 red,green, blue, and black pen, 22 pack of 4 aqueou black,
7 pack of 4 aqueou r,g,blue,black,  1 pack of 6 aqueou multi color
pen,  and 114 assort non-packag pen mostli color.

    the plotter is us.  i have test it us the window driver for
hp 7570 and hp 7574 and both work fine.  it accept either a or b
size paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).

    i figur that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pen ar worth at
least anoth $200 more..  on thing is certain, you won't need to
purchas ani pen for quit a while...  all of the packag pen were
seal so thei ar all still fresh.  the rest were cap and seem to
function as well.

    i'd be will to sell the pen seper if anyon is interest in
just them.

    i'm sell it becaus i got a hp laserjet and i don't need color.

    i'd like $350 or best offer...
