ye but a kei issu is _speed_ how fast is imagin? and is it as easi to
us
as 3d studio? can it just do a render as fast as 3ds if you don't want
thing like ior etc.. 3ds can do fine shadow, anim reflect map,
anim bump map, anim anyth map, and with the ipa routin 
(not that i've ever seen them) it can do explos, top qualiti
morph, fire, rain, len flare etc..
i'm not knock imagin, i just want to know how it compar with 3ds
