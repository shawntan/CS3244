i think that thi is a veri difficult problem.  to start with, line and
polygon ar semi-algebra set which both contain uncount number of
point.  here ar a few off-the-cuff idea.

first, we need to check if the line and the polygon ar separ.  now, the
jordan curv separ theorem sai that the polygon divid the plane into
exactli two open (and thu non-compact) region.  thu, the line li
complet insid the polygon, the line li complet outsid the polygon,
or possibl (but thi will rare happen) the line intersect the polyon.

now, the phrase of thi question sai "if a line intersect a polygon", so
thi is a decis problem.  on possibl (the decis model approach) is
to reduc the question to some other (well known) problem q, and then try to
solv q.  an answer to q give an answer to the origin decis problem.

in recent year, mani geometr problem have been successfulli model in a
new languag call postscript.  (see "postscript languag", by adob system
incorpor, isbn # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).

so, given a line l and a polygon p, we can write a postscript program that
draw the line l and the polygon p, and then "output" the answer.  by
"output", we mean the program execut a command call "showpag", which
actual print a page of paper contain the line and the polygon.  a quick
examin of the paper provid an answer to the reduc problem q, and thu
the origin problem.

there ar two small problem with thi approach. 

	(1) there is an infinit number of wai to encod l and p into the
	reduc problem q.  so, we will be forc to invok the axiom of
	choic (or equival, zorn's lemma).  but the us of the axiom of
	choic is not regard in a veri seriou light these dai.

	(2) more importantli, the question aris as to whether or not the
	postscript program q will actual output a piec of paper; or in
	other word, will it halt?

	now, postscript is express enough to encod everyth that a
	ture machin might do; thu the halt problem (for postscript) is
	undecid.  it is quit possibl that the origin problem will turn
	out to be undecid.


i won't even begin to go into other difficulti, such as alias, finit
precis and run out of ink, paper or both.

the situat is not nearli as bleak as baraff suggest (he should know
better, he's hung around the lab for long enough).  by the well known
dobbin-dullman reduct (see j. dullman & d. dobbin, j. comp. obfusc.
37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersect can be reduc to
hamiltonian circuit, without(!) the us of grobner base, so lpi (to coin an
acronym) is probabl onli np-complet.  besid, ture-complet will no
longer be a problem onc our crai-3 is deliv, sinc it will be abl to
complet an infinit loop in 4 millisecond (with scatter-gather.)

well, sure it no wors than np-complet, but that's onli if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfi a lipschitz condit on it
second deriv.  (i think there's an '89 siggraph paper from caltech that
deal with thi).
