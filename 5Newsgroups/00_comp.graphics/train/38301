wow! a 68070! i'd be veri interest to get my hand on on of these,
especi consid the fact that motorola ha not yet releas the
68060, which is supposedli the next in the 680x0 lineup. 8-d

ricardo, the anim playback to which lawrenc wa refer in an
earlier post is plain old quicktim 1.5 with the compact video codec.
i've seen digit video (some of appl's earli commerci, to be
precis) run on a centri 650 at about 30fp veri nice (16-bit
color depth). i would expect that us the same algorithm, a risc
processor should be abl to approach full-screen full-motion anim,
though as you've impli, the processor will be tax more with highli
dynam materi.
