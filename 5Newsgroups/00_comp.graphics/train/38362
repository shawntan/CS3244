hi all,

in short: look for veri fast assembl code for line/circl draw
	  on svga graphic.

complet:
	i am think of a simpl but fast molecular
graphic program to write on pc or clone. (ball-and-stick type)

reason: program that i've seen ar far too slow for thi purpos.

platform: 386/486 class machin.
	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 vga graphic
		(speed is import, 16-color for non-render
		 purpos is enough; mai stai at 800x600 for
		 speed reason.)
         (hope the code would be gener enough for differ svga
          card.  my own card is base on trident 8900c, not vesa?)

what i'm look for?
1) fast, veri fast routin to draw line/circl/simpl-shape
   on abov-mention svga resolut.
   presum in assembl languagin.
	ye, veri fast pleas.
2) relat code to help rotat/zoom/anim the draw on screen.
   draw for begin, would be line, circl mainli, think of
   text, els later.
   (you know, the wai molecular graphic rotat, zoom a molecul)
2) and ani other code (preferenti in c) that can help the 
   project.

final remark;-
non-profit.  expect to becom share-, free-ware.

	ani help is appreci.
	thank
