i think he want to avoid reinvent the wheel.
i would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to
comp.sy.mac.binari to be distribut (includ to the ftp site). 
mani folk, myself includ, would enjoi the extra code.

just to clarifi, the 3d routin that ar mention in variou place
on the mac ar in a librai, not the rom of the mac.  a few year ago befor
i knew anyth about implement graphic, i came across a demo of the
appl grafsi3d librari and it actual did a lot.  howev, it is quit
limit in the sens that it's a low-level 3d librari; your code still ha
to plot individu point, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  it ha noth
on gl, for exampl, where you can handl object.

other thing to consid when talk about appl's old 3d grafsi librari:

* unsupport;  never wa and no plan exist to do so in the futur

* undocu; unless you call header file document...

if on know someth about graphic, you could probabl figur it out,
but i'd assum there's better softwar avail that give better
output and is, at the same time, programmat nicer (i.e. easier to
program).

just my 2% tax
