it's not a bad question: i don't have ani ref that list thi algorithm
either. but think about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.

1) take three of the point and find the plane thei defin as well as
the circl that thei lie on (you sai you have thi algorithm alreadi)

2) find the center  of thi circl. the line pass through thi center
perpendicular to the plane of the three point pass through the center of
the sphere.

3) repeat with the unus point and two of the origin point. thi
give you two differ line that both pass through the sphere's
origin. their interect is the center of the sphere.

4) the radiu is easi to comput, it's just the distanc from the center to
ani of the origin point.

i'll leav the math to you, but thi is a workabl algorithm. :-)


an altern method would be to take pair of point: the plane form
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contain the
center of the sphere. three pair will form three plane, intersect
at a point. thi might be easier to implement.
