dmorf (dave's morph, i think is what it mean) and dtax (dave's 
tga assembl) ar avail in the msdo_upload directori
on the wuarchiv.

thei ar arj and bundl with their respect xmemori version,
dmorfx.ex and dtax.ex, you can also find a version of aaplai.ex
there, with which you can view file you creat with dta.ex or
dtax.ex.

i download the whole bunch last week and have been morph 
awai the afternoon sinc.  the programm ar all a bit buggi and
definit not-readi-to-spread-to-the-mass, but thei ar veri
well written. 

the interfac is frustrat at first, but it get easi onc you
figur out the trick.

i have notic that dmorfx will crash horribl if you try to morph
without us the spline option.  not sure why, sinc i don't have
the sourc.  i think it wa written for tp 6.0.

if anyon els come up with ani other hint on get the thing 
to work right, tell me; it took me sever hour the first time
just to figur out that if i just us the durn spline then 
it would work...
