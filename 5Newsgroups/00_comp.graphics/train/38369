i'm interest in simul revers (or neg) color video
mathemat.  what is the transform?  is it a simpl
revers of the hue valu in the hsv color space?  is it
a manipul in the yuv color space?  how is it relat
to solar?

if you want to see someth truli wild, turn on the
revers video effect on a camcord so equip,
and point it at the monitor.  thi creat a chaotic
dynam system whose phase space is continu along
rotat, zoom, focu, etc.  veri veri surpris and 
love.  i'd like to write a simul of thi effect
without analog grung.  thank for ani info you mai have.

pleas e-mail ani info to me.  i'll post a summari.

thank,
