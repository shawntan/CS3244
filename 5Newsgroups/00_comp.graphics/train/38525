i'm not sure if you got the inform you were look for, so i'll
post it anywai for the gener public.  to load an imag on your root
window add thi line to the end of your .xsession file:

 xloadimag -onroot -fullscreen <gif_file_name> &

thi is assum of cours you have the xloadimag client, and as
for the switch, i think thei pretti much explain what is go on.
if you leav out the <&>, the termin lock till you kill it.
(you alreadi knew that though...)

hope thi help.
