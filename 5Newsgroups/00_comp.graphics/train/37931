#i us xwd/xpr (from the x11r5 dist.) and variou program of the
#ppm-tool to print hardcopi of color x window. my problem is,

i don't like xpr. it give (at least, the x11r4 version doe) louzi
output: the hardcopi look veri graini to me.
instead, i us pnmtop. thi take full advantag postscript, and
let the printer do the dirti job of dither a (graylevel)
imag to black and white dot.

so: if you have a postscript printer, try:
	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to ppm
	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print
	pnmtop -noturn |	# .. to postscript
	lpr			# print

pnmtop ha sever neat option, but us them with care:
if you want your imag to be 4" wide, us:
	pnmtop -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
-noturn prevent the imag from be rotat (if it is wider than it
	is high)
-width 4 specifi the paper width (not the imag width - see below)
-scale 100 is us becaus if the imag is small, it mai fit within a
	width less than 4", and will thu be print smaller than 4" wide.
	if you first scale it up a lot, it will certainli not fit in 4", and
	will be scale down by pnmtop automat to fit the specifi
	paper width. 
	in short: pnmtop will scale an imag down to fit the paper size,
	but it will not blow it up automat.

hope thi help.
