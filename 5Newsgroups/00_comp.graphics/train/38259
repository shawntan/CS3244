hi everyon,

i thought that some peopl mai be interest in my vr
softwar on these group:

*******announc the releas of multivers-1.0.2*******

multivers is a multi-user, non-immers, x-window base virtual realiti
system, primarili focus on entertain/research.

featur:

   client-server base model, us berkelei socket.
   no limit to the number of user (apart from perform).
   gener client.
   customiz server.
   hierach object (allow attach of camera and light sourc).
   multipl light sourc (ambient, point and spot).
   object can have extens code, to handl uniqu function, easili
        attach.

function:

  client:
   the client is built around a 'fast' render loop. basic it chang thing
   when told to by the server and then render an imag from the user's
   viewpoint. it also provid the server with inform about the user's
   action - which can then be commun to other client and therefor to
   other user.

   the client is design to be gener - in other word you don't need to
   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. thi mean that
   resourc can be spent on enhanc the client softwar rather than adapt
   it. the adapt, as will be explain in a moment, occur in the server.

   thi releas of the client softwar support the follow function:

    o hierarch object (with associ address)

    o multipl light sourc and type (ambient, point and spot)

    o user interfac panel

    o colour polygon render with phong shade (option wirefram for
	faster frame rate)

    o mous and keyboard input

   (some peopl mai be disappoint that thi softwar doesn't support the
   powerglov as an input devic - thi is not becaus it can't, but becaus
   i don't have on! thi will, howev, be on of the first enhanc!)

  server(s):
   thi is where custom can take place. the follow basic support is
   provid in thi releas for potenti world server develop:

    o transpar client manag

    o client messag handl

   thi mai not sound like much, but it take awai the headach of
accept and
   termin client and receiv messag from them - the
applic writer
   can work with the assumpt that thing ar happen local.

   thing get more interest in the object extens function. thi is
   what is provid to allow you to anim your object:

    o server select extens instal:
        what thi mean is that you can decid which object have extend
        function in your world. basic you call the extens
        initialis you want.

    o event handler registr:
        when you develop extens for an object you basic write callback
        function for the event that you want the object to respond to.
        (current event support: init, move, chang, collid & termin)

    o collis detect registr:
        if you want your object to respond to collis event just provid
        some basic inform to the collis detect manag softwar.
        your callback will be activ when a collis occur.

    thi softwar is kept separ from the worldserv applic becaus
    the applic develop want to build a librari of extend object
    from which to choos.

    the follow is all you need to make a world server applic:

    o provid an initworld function:
        thi is where you choos what object extens will be support, plu
        ani initi you want to do.

    o provid a positionobject function:
        thi is where you determin where to place a new client.

    o provid an installworldobject function:
        thi is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.

    o provid a getworldtyp function:
        thi is where you tell a new client what persona thei should have.

    o provid an animateworld function:
        thi is where you can go wild! at a minimum you should let the object
        move (by call a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit
        (to avoid outrun the client).

    that's all there is to it! and to prove it here ar the line count for the
    three world server i've provid:

        gener - 81 line
        dactyl - 270 line (more complic collis detect due to the
                           stair! will probabl be improv with futur
                           version)
        dogfight - 72 line

locat:

   thi softwar is locat at the follow site:
   ftp.u.washington.edu

   directori:
   pub/virtual-world

   file:
   multivers-1.0.2.tar.z

futur:

   client:

    o textur map.

    o more realist render: i.e. z-buffer (or similar), gouraud shade

    o hmd support.

    o etc, etc....

   server:

    o physic model (graviti, friction etc).

    o enhanc object manag/interact

    o etc, etc....

   both:

    o improv comm!!!

i hope thi provid peopl with a good understand of the multivers
softwar,
unfortun it come with practic zero document, and i'm not sure
whether that will ever be abl to be rectifi! :-(

i hope peopl enjoi thi softwar and that it is us in our explor of
the virtual univers - i've certainli found fascin develop it, and i
would *love* to add support for the powerglov...and an hmd :-)!!

final on major disclaim:

thi is total amateur code. by that i mean there is no support for thi code
other than what i, out the kind of my heart, or you, out of pure
desper, provid. i cannot be held respons for anyth good or bad
that mai happen through the us of thi code - us it at your own risk!

disclaim over!

of cours if you love it, i would like to here from you. and anyon with
posit contribut/critic is also encourag to contact me. anyon who
hate it: > /dev/null!

************************************************************************

and if anyon want to let me do thi for a live: you know where to
write :-)!
