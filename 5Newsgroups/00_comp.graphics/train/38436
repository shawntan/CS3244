in all fair, how mani peopl do you know person who read imag
from floppi drive?  i haven't tri it with jpeg, but i do realiz how
agonizingli slow it is with gif file.  

nevertheless, it is an import bug that need to be squash.  i am
mere point out that it wa probabl overlook.  while it is seriou,
on must keep in mind that it will probabl affect at most 5% of the
target user of cview.
