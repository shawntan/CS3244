curious, in modern postscript, the point in a polygon problem can
be solv even more easili.  to wit:

%!
%%titl: point in polygon
%%creator: allen b (ab@cc.purdu.edu)
%%for: the amus of comp.graphic regular
%%languagelevel: 2
%%documentneededresourc: humor sens thereof
%%endcom

% thi program will test whether a point is insid a given polygon.
% current it us the even-odd rule, but that can be chang by
% replac ineofil with infil.  these ar level 2 oper,
% so if you've onli got level 1 you're out of luck.
%
% the result will be print on the output stream.
%
% caution: onli accur to devic pixel!
% put a huge scale in first if you aren't sure.

% point to test
% put x and y coordin here

50 75

% vertic of polygon in counter-clockwis order
% put arrai of pair of coordin here
