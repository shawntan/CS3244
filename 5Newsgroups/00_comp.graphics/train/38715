i need inform on the displai postscript strokeadjust featur.
thi featur adjust the endpoint of line so that the displai line
look better on low resolut devic.

the postscript literatur explain the process to some extent.  thei
also give an exampl of how to "emul" strokeadjust in postscript
environ where it is absent.

the suggest emul is to modifi the coordin of the endpoint
of a line us the follow formula for each coordin:

	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25
	
do thi we end up with all coordin end in ".25".  from
read i thought that what thei might actual do is:

	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25
	
thi result in all the coordin end in either "0.25" or "0.75" 
whichev is closer.

by do some actual comparison with displai postscript, i find that
neither of these is what dp realli us.  sinc i like how the dp
result look better than how my stuff look, i'd like to know if
anyon who know how dp doe it is will/abl to tell me.

thank,
