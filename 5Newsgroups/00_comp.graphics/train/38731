	i wa recent talk to a possibl employ ( mine! :-) ) and he made a refer to a
48-bit graphic comput/imag process system.  i seem to rememb it be call imag or
someth akin to that.  anywai, he claim it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel.  that's
60 bit of info--what could that possibl be for?  specif the 48-bit color?  that's 280
trillion color, mani more than the human ey can resolv.  is thi an anti-alias thing?  or
is thi just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.

	also, to settl a bet with my roommat, what ar sgi's flagship product?  i know of
iri, indigo, and crimson, but what ar the other on, and which is their top-of-the-line?
(sadli, i have access to none of them.  just a dec 5000/25.  sigh.)
