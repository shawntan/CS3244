sorri about not mention platform... my origin post wa to mac.programm,
and then decid to post here to comp.graphic.

i'd like the 3d softwar to run on primarili mac in either c, object pascal
(think or mpw). but, i'll port to window later, so a packag that run on
mac and ha a window version would be ideal.

i'm look for a packag that ha low upfront cost, and reason licens
cost... of cours :)
