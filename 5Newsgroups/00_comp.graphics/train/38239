up until last week, i have been run povrai v1.0 on my 486/33 under do5
without ani major problem.  over easter i increas the memori from 4meg to
8meg, and found that povrai reboot the system everi time under do5.  i had
a go at run povrai in a do window when run win3.1 on the same system
and it now work fine, even if a lot slower.  i would like to go back to 
us povrai directli under do, anyon ani idea???
