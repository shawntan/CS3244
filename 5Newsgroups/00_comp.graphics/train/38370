the problem is not precis defin abov, but if you need to find
the smallest convex polygon that enclos a given polygon, then
you ar seek the convex hull of your origin polygon.  there
ar two wai to do thi:  us a somewhat tricki but by-now well
examin linear-time algorithm that exploit the polygon boundari,
or just feed the vertic of the origin polygon to a convex hull
routin and accept o(n log n).  both method ar discuss in
preparata and shamo, for exampl.
