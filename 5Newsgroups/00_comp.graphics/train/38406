look for a graphic/cad/or-whatev packag on a x-unix box that will
take a file with record like:

n  a  b  p

where n = a count  - integ 
      a = entiti a - string
      b = entiti b - string
      p = type     - string

and produc a network graph with node repres with box or circl
and the vertic repres by line and the width of the line determin by
n.  there would be a differ line type for each type of vertic. the box
need to be identifi with the entiti's name.  the number of entiti < 1000
and vertic < 100000.  it would be nice if the tool minim line
cross-over and did a good job of layout.  ;-)

  i have look in the faq for comp.graphic and gnuplot without success. ani
idea would be appreci?

thank,
