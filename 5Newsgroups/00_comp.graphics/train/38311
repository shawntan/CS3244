i don't think speed ha been determin, sinc it ha never run on intel chip.
but on the amiga's motorola chip, it wa on of the fastest true 'rai tracer'

i don't think impuls would port it over and not take speed into consider.

in term of featur, and learn curv... all that you state for 3ds is also
true for imagin, and lot more... but i'll have to admit that after 3 year of
us on the amiga, the learn curv is veri steep. thi is due onli to the
manual. it is reali bad. howev, there is a lot of after market support for
thi product, includ regular 'tip' articl in mani magazin such as "avid
and a great book by steve worlei call "understand imagin 2.0" thi book i
is not just recommen, it is a must!

i think an import consider should be price......
$3000 for 3ds (not includ "tool" packag)
under $500 for imagin complet.
