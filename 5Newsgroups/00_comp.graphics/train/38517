there ar sever public domain util avail at your usual
archiv site that allow 'extract' of singl frame from a .gl
file, check in the 'graphic' directori under *grasp.  the problem 
is that the .clp file you gener cannot be decod by ani of 
the mani pd format convert i have us. ani hint welcom!
let me know if you have problem locat the util.
hope it help.
