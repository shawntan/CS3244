look for edg inconsist.  consid two vertic, p and q, which
ar connect by at least on edg.

if (p,q) is an edg, then (q,p) should *not* appear.  

if *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edg, then the surfac "flip" when
you travel across that edg.  thi is bad.  

assum (warn...warn...warn) that you have an otherwis
accept surfac - you can pick an edg, ani edg, and travers the
surfac enforc consist with that edg.  

    0) pick an edg (p,q), and mark it as "ok"
    1) for each face, f, contain thi edg (if more than 2, oop)
       make sure that all edg in f ar consist (i.e., the face
       should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  flip those which
       ar wrong. mark all of the edg in f as "ok",
       and add them to a queue (check for duplic, and especi
       inconsist - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)). 
    2) remov an edg from the queue, and go to 1).

if a *mark* edg is discov to be inconsist, then you lose.

if step 1) find more than on face share a particular edg, then you
lose. 
    
otherwis, when done, all of the edg will be consist.  which mean
that all of the surfac normal will either point in or out.  decid
which wai is out is left as an exercis...
