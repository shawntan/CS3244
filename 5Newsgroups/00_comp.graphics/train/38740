hi !

if you want to have soft-scroll on your vga, you have to chang some 
intern regist of the crtc. but it is a littl bit difficult to explain, 
so i would suggest, you take a look at "the program of the 
ega/vga-adapt" by addison-weslei. you will find all us descript 
for everi avail vga-regist.
