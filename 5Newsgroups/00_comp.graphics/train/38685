for some reason i never saw the origin post on thi thread, but if you ar
look for fast polygon routin on vga on a pc, you realli can't go past
the mode x stuff from dr dobb. thi code is all p.domain (as far as i know),
and in the origin articl, the routin were all present as dumb vga
routin, and then optimis to modex with some interest discuss along
the wai.
if you ar interest, i could find out more detail of the issu in question,
(i have them at home).
