unfortun the poster want to us an intern and an extern modem so a
switch isn't go to help them.  if you aren't us your com port for
anyth els, just defin them on differ com port.  defin your intern
modem to be sai, com1, and your extern modem to be com3.  you realli
shouldn't have to worri about interrupt conflict sinc you won't be us
both modem at the same time :).
