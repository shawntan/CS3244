i am look for a program that is capabl of displai a graph
with node and link and with the possibl to edit interact
the graph : add on node, chang on link etc...

actual, a veri _simpl_ x11 program would be ok; all i need is to
put some "box" (i.e. the node ) on a pane and be abl to
manipul them with the mous (move, add or delet box).

doe anyon know if such program is avail ?
thank for ani help !!
