first, thank to all who repli to my origin question.

i've implement the idea from the articl abov and i'm veri satisfi
with the result. i need it for my bezier curv approxim routin.
in some case (gener offset curv) loop can occur. i now have a
fast method of detect the gener of a curv with a loop. although
i did not follow the articl abov strictli. the check if the fourth control
point li in the the loop area, which is bound by two parabola and
on ellip is too complic. instead i enlarg the loop-area and
surround it by for straight line. the check is now simpl and fast and
my approxim routin never ever output self-intersect bezier curv
again!
