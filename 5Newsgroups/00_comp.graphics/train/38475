hi! everyon,

becaus no on ha touch the problem i post last week, i guess
my question wa not so clear. now i'd like to describ it in detail:

the offset of an ellips is the locu of the center of a circl which
roll on the ellips. in other word, the distanc between the ellips
and it offset is same everywher.

thi problem come from the geometr measur when a probe is us.
the tip of the probe is a ball and the comput just output the
posit of the ball's center. is the offset of an ellips still
an ellips? the answer is no! iron, dmi - an american indutri
standard sai it is ellips. so almost all the softwar which wa
implement on the base of dmi wa wrong. the softwar wa also sold
internationali. imagin, how mani peopl have or will suffer from thi bug!!!
how mani qualifi part with ellips were/will be discard? and most
importantli, how mani defect part with ellips ar/will be us?

i wa emploi as a consult by a compani in lo angel last year
to special solv thi problem. i spent two month on analysi of thi
problem and six month on program. now my solut (nonlinear)
is not ideal becaus i can onli reconstruct an ellips from it entir
or half offset. it is veri difficult to find the origin ellips from
a quarter or a segment of it offset becaus the method i us is not
analyt. i am now wonder if i didn't touch the base and make thing
complic. pleas give me a hint.

i know you mai argu thi is not a cg problem. you ar right, it is not.
howev, so mani peopl involv in the problem "sphere from 4 poit".
why not an ellips? and why not it offset?

pleas post here and let the other share our interest 
(i got sever email from our netter, thei said thei need the
summari of the answer).

yeh
