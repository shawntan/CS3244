why would it have to be much faster (it probabl is) ? assum an arm
is about as effici as a mip r3000 for integ calcul, do
a compact-video-like digit video codec is an easi task. for softwar
motion pictur (which is a lot like compact video, though it predat
it), we get 48 frame/sec. at 320x240 on a decstat 5000/200. that
machin ha a 25 mhz mip r3000.
