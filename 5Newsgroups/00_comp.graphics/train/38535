[pleas, note the newsgroup.]

recent discuss about xv's problem were held in some newsgroup.
here is some text user of xv might find interest.
i have ad more to text to thi collect articl, so read on, even
you so my articl a while ago.

i hope author of xv correct those problem as best he can, so fine
program xv is that it is worth of improv.
(i have also minor idea for 24bit xv, e-mail me for them.)

ani misundertand of mine is understand.

note that 'xv' save onli 8bit/raster imag; that mean that
the save jpeg ar just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg qualiti.
also, there's three kind of 8bit quantiz; your final imag qualiti
depend on them too.
 
thi were the situat when i read jpeg faq a while ago.
 
imho, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confus
error in program.
there's two error:
  -xv allow the save of 8bit/raster imag as jpeg even the
   origin is 24bit -- save 8bit/raster imag instead of
   origin 24bit should be a special case
  -xv allow save the 8bit/raster imag made with ani quantiz
   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantiz the imag with the
   best quantiz avail befor save the imag to a file; lousier
   quantiz should be just for view purpos (and a special case
   in save the imag, if at all)

it is limit of *xv*, but not limit of design.
it is error in design.
it is error that 8bit/quantiz/raster imag ar store as jpeg;
jpeg is not design to that.

as matter of fact, i'm sure when xv were design 24bit displai were
known. it is not bad error to program a program for 8bit imag onli
at that time, but when 24bit imag format ar includ to program the
whole design should be chang to support 24bit imag.
that were not done and now we have
 -the program violat jpeg design (and ani 24bit imag format)
 -the program ha human interfac error.

otherwai is to drop save imag as jpeg or ani 24bit format without
clearli sai that it is special case and not expect in normal us.

some new item follow.

i have seen that xv quantiz the imag sometim poorli with -best24
option than with default option we have.
the reason sure is the quantiz us as -best24; it is (surpris)
the same than us in ppmquant.

if you rememb, i have test some quantiz. in that test i found
that rlequant (with default) is best, then come djpeg, fbmquant, xv
(our default) in that order. in my test ppmquant suggeed veri poorli
-- it actual gave imag with bad artifact.

i don't know is ppmquant improv ani, but i expect no.
so, us of xv's -best24 option is not veri good idea.

i suggest that author of xv chang the quantiz to the on us in
rlequant -- i'm sure rle-peopl give permiss.
(anoth could be on us in imagemagick; i have not test it, so i
can sai noth about it.)

some minor bug in human interfac ar:

kei press and cursor click goe to a buffer; often it happen
that i make click error or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong
place. it is veri annoi when you have wait imag to come about
five minut and then it is gone awai immedi.
the buffer should be clean when the imag is complet.

also, good idea is to wait few second befor activ keyboard
and mous for xv after the imag is complet.
often it happen that imag pop to the screen quickli, just when
i'm write someth with editor or such. those kei press
then go to xv and imag ha gone or someth weird.

in the color editor, when i turn a color meter and releas it, xv
updat the imag. it is imposs to chang all rgb valu first
and then get the updat imag. it is annoi wait imag to be
updat when the set ar not readi yet.
i suggest of ad an 'appli' button to updat the exchang done.
