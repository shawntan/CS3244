funni thing, the internet: i have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it
might be someth to do with x-window on pc (? if you know, and have us
it, and think that it is good, email me. [ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au]).

dv/x is a common abbrevi for quarterdeck corpor's desqview/x
softwar.

i have not us dv/x yet, but read the blurb that quarterdeck sent me, it
sound pretti great:
	* allow multipl do machin - the wai that os/2 doe, but without
requir 10 mb of ram to get os/2 go
	* pre-emptiv multi-task
	* network comput - a proper x-window client/server applic -
thi mean that do program can be us on other x-window comput on your
network, and that x-window program can be us on your dv/x comput
	* although it is not a version of unix, it effect ha mani of
unix's featur, and mostli you will be abl to compil unix-type program
us the djgpp or gnu c compil

thei advertis regularli in all of the major comput and program
magazin. thei also have internet support onlin (support@qdeck.com).
