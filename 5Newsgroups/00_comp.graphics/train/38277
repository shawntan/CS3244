i agre with you about the upgrad path; but i think i wa fair.

the origin post complain (1) about sgi come out with newer (and
better) architectur and not have an upgrad path from the older on,
and (2) that dec did.

on statement (1), i mere attempt to point out that all comput
compani ar constantli attempt to improv their product (& market
posit/share).  in so do, thei eventu come to a point where thei
have a new architectur, and the onli upgrad path is to replac the
system.  and the particular system he wa complain about wa (in
comput lifetim) rel old.

on statement (2), i felt dec's histori of provid upgrad wa not far
superior than the industri "averag", and that, in my opinion, sgi's
histori is better than dec's.

(and what is dec do with it's mip base decstat line?  ar thei
go to "abandon" it for their alpha base line, or provid an upgrad
path to r4400's and tfp's and r5's?)
