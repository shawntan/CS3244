actuallai i don't, but on the other hand i don't support the idea of have
on newsgroup for everi aspect of graphic program as propos by brian,
in hi repli to my origin post.
i would suggest a looser structur more like a comp.graphic.programm,
comp.graphic.hw_and_sw
the reason for make as few group as possibl is for the same reason you
sai we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few post everi dai.
i take to much time to brows through all post just to find two or 
three i'm interest in.

i understand and agre when you sai you want all aspect of graphic in on
meet. i agre to some extens. i see new as a forum to exchang idea,
help other or to be help. i think thi is difficult to achiv if there
ar so mani differ thing in on meet.

good even netter|-)
