g'dai all,

can anybodi point me at a util which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/
displai hdf imag file ? i've had a look at the hdf stuff under ncsa 
and it must take an award for odd directori structur, strang storag
approach and minimalist document :-)

part of the problem is that i want to look at larg (5mb+) hdf file and
crop out a section. ideal i would like a hdftoppm type of util, from
which i can then us the pbmplu stuff quit merrili. i can convert the crop
part into anoth format for view/anim.

otherwis, can someon pleas explain how to set up the ncsa visualis s/w
for hdf (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the abov crop/etc. thi is for
sun with suno 4.1.2.
