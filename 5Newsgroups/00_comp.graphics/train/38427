have thought about thi, why don't you project the 2 line onto the 2d
plane form by the line.  do an intersect calcul in the plane in
2d, where you're guarante a uniqu solut (unless thei're parallel which
won't happen in thi case), and then us parametr distanc along the line
from the circl centr to determin the exact point of interest.  thi
bypass the messi error propog requir to do the calcul in 3d.

hope i haven't put my foot in it again!
