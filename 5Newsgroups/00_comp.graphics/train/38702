hi noel,

i've made some attempt to write a convert that read adob type 1 font,
triangul them, bevel them and extrud them to result in a gener
3d object which could be us with pov f.i.

the problem i'm current stuck on is that there no algorithm which
triangul ani arbitrari polygon shape. delaunai seem to be limit
to convex hull. constrain delaunai mai be okai, but i have no code
exampl of how to do it.

anoth wai to do the bartman mai be

- tga2pov
- a selfmad variat of thi, us heightfield.

  creat a b/w pictur (big) of the text you need, f.i. us a postscript
  preview. then, us thi as a heightfield. if it is white on black,
  the heightfield is exactli the imag white part (it's still open
  on the backsid). to close it, mirror it and compound it with the origin.

exampl:

object {
   union {
      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" }
      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" scale <1 -1 1>}
   }
   textur {
      glass
   }
   translat <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center
   rotat <-90 0 0>             // rotat upward
   scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker
   translat <0 2 0>            // final placement
}


abp2.gif is a gif of arbitrari size contain "abp" black on white in
time-roman 256 point.
