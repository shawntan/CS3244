thi sound wonder, but it seem no on either want to spend time do
thi, or thei don't have the power to do so.  for exampl, i would like
to see a comp.graphic architectur like thi:

comp.graphic.algorithm.2d
comp.graphic.algorithm.3d
comp.graphic.algorithm.misc
comp.graphic.hardwar
comp.graphic.misc
comp.graphic.softwar/app

howev, that is almost overkil.  someth more like thi would probabl
make everyon a lot happier:

comp.graphic.programm
comp.graphic.hardwar
comp.graphic.app
comp.graphic.misc

it would be nice to see special group devot to 2d, 3d, morph,
raytrac, imag process, interact graphic, toolkit, languag,
object system, etc. but these could be post to a relev group or
have a mail list organ.

that wai when someon read new thei don't have to see these subject
head, which ar rather dispar:

system specif stuff ( should be under comp.sy or comp.os.???.programm ):

	"need help program gl"
	"modex program inform?"
	"fast sprite on pc"

hardwar technic stuff:

	"speed of weitek p9000"
	"driver for speedstar 24x"

applic orient stuff:

	"vistapro 3.0 help"
	"how good is 3dstudio?"
	"best imag process program for amiga"

program orient stuff:

	"fast polygon routin need"
	"good morph alogirhtm want"
	"best depth sort for triangl?"
	"which c++ librari to get?"

i wish someon with the power would get a cfd and then a cfv go on
thi stuff....thi newsgroup need it.
