       moscow scientif inductri associ "spectrum" offer
       videoscan vision system for pc/at,wich includ softwar and set of
       control.

                     softwar

            for support videoscan famili program kit wa develop. kit
       includ more then 200 differ function for imag process.
            kit work in the interact regim, and ha includ help for
       non profession user.
            there ar next possibl:
       - input frame by ani board of videoscan famili;
       - read - white imag to - from disk;
       - print imag on the printer;
       - make arithmet with 2 frame;
       - filter imag;
       - work with gistogramm;
       - edit imag.
       - includ user ex modul.

                     control vs9

       the function of vs-9 control is to load tv-imag into  pc/at.
       vs-9 control allow on to load a fragment of the tv-frame from
       a field of 724x600 pixel.
       the clock rate is 14,7 mhz when load an imag with 512 pixel in
       the line and 7,4 mhz when load a 256 pixel imag. thi
       provid the equal pixel size of input imag in both horizont
       and vertic direct.
       the number of grai level in ani input mode is 256.
       video signal captur time - 2.5s.

                     control vs52

       the purpos of the control is to enter the tv imag into a ibm
       pc at or ani other machin of that type. the control wa
       creat on the base of modern element, includ user
       programm gate arrai.
       the control allow to digit a input signal with differ
       resolut. it flexibl architectur make possibl to chang
       technic paramet. instead of tv signal on can process ani
       other analog signal (includ signal from slow-speed scan
       devic).
       the control ha the follow technic characterist:
       - memori volum - from 256 k to 2 mb ;
       - resolut when work with standard video signal - from 64x64
       to 1024x512 pixel ;
       - resolut when work in slow input regim - up to 2048x1024
       pixel;
       - video signal captur time - 40 ms.
       - maximum size of a screen when memori volum is 2mb - 2048x1024
       pixel ;
       - number of grai level - 256 ;
       - clock rate for input - up to 30 mhz ;
       - 4 input video multiplex ;
       - input/output lookup tabl (lut);
       - possibl to realiz "scroll" and "zoom";













       - 8 line for extern synchron (an input us extern
       control signal) ;
       - electron adjust of black and white refer for analog -
       digit convert;
       - possibl output imag to the color rgb monitor.
       on can chang all list abov function and paramet of the
       control by reprogram it.


              imag processor vs100


            imag processor vs100 allow to digit and process tv
       signal in real time. it is possibl digit tv signal with
       512*512*8 resolut and realiz arithmet and logic oper
       with two imag.
            processor wa creat on the base of modern element
       includ user programm gate arrai and design as a board
       for pc.
            memori volum allow write to the 256 frame with 512*512*8
       format. it is possibl to accumul until 16 imag.
            the processor ha the follow technic characterist:
       - memori volum to 64 mb;
       - number of the grai level - 256;
       - 4 input video multiplex;
       - input/output lookup tabl;
       - electron adjust for black and white adc refer;
       - imag size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;
       - possibl color and black / white output;
       - possibl input from slow-scan video sourc.
