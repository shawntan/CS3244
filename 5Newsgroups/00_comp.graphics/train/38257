sorri i miss you raymond, i wa just out in dahlgren last month...

i'm the virtual realiti market manag for silicon graphic, so perhap i
can help a littl.

unfortun, while sgi system were us to creat the special effect
for both termin 2 and lawnmow man, those ar film-qualiti comput
graphic, render in softwar and written to film a frame at a time.  each
frame of comput anim for those film took hour to render on
high-end parallel process comput system. thu, that level of graphic
would be difficult, if not imposs, to acheiv in real time (30 frame
per second).

it depend upon how seriou you ar and how advanc your applic is.
true immers visual (vr), requir the render of complex visual
databas at anywher from 20 to 60 newli render frame per second.  thi
is a similar requir to that of tradit flight simul for pilot
train. if the frame rate is too low, the user notic the step of
the frame as thei move their head rapidli around the scene, so the motion
of the graphic is not smooth and contigu.  thu the graphic system
must be power enough to sustain high frame rate while render complex
data represent.

addition, the frame rate must be constant.  if the system render 15
frame per second at on point, then 60 frame per second the next (perhap
due to the scene in the new view direct be simpler than what wa
visibl befor), the user can get heavili distract by the medium (the
graphic comput) rather than focus on the data. to maintain a constant
frame rate, the system must be abl to run in real-time.  unix in gener
doe not support real-time oper, but silicon graphic ha modifi the
unix kernel for it multi-processor system to be abl to support real-time
oper, bypass the usual unix process prioriti-manag scheme. 
uniprocessor system run unix cannot fundament support real-time
oper (not sun sparc10, not hp 700 seri system, not ibm rs-6000, not
even sgi's uniprocessor system like indigo or crimson). onli our
multiprocessor onyx and challeng system support real-time oper due
to their symmetr multi-process (smp) share-memori architectur.

from a graphic perspect, render complex virtual environ
requir advanc render techniqu like textur map and real-time
multi-sampl anti-alias.  of all of the gener purpos graphic system
on the market todai, onli crimson realityengin and onyx realityengin2
system fulli support these capabl. the anti-alias is particularli
import, as the crawl jag edg of alias polygon is an
unfortun distract when immers in a virtual environ.

you can us the gener purpos graphic librari list abov to develop
vr applic, but that is start at a pretti low level. there ar
off-the- shelf softwar packag avail to get you go much faster,
be target directli at the vr applic develop. some of the most
popular ar (in no particular order):

	- divis inc.		    (redwood citi, ca) - dv
	- sen8 inc.		    (sausalito, ca)    - worldtoolkit
	- naval postgradu school (monterei, ca)     - npsnet (free!)
	- gemini technolog corp    (irvin, ca)       - gv simat seri
	- paradigm simul inc.  (dalla, tx)       - visionwork, audiowork
	- silicon graphic inc.	    (mountain view,ca) - iri perform

there ar some other, but not off the top of my head...

there ar too mani to list here, but here is a smatter:

	- fake space lab	    (menlo park,ca)    - boom
	- virtual technolog inc. (stanford, ca)     - cyberglov
	- digit imag design	    (new york, ny)     - the cricket (3d input)
	- kaiser electro optic	    (carlsbad, ca)     - sim ey helmet displai
	- virtual research	    (sunnyval, ca)    - flight helmet displai
	- virtual realiti inc.	    (pleasantvil,ny) - head mtd displai, s/w
	- softwar system	    (san jose, ca)     - 3d model softwar
	- etc., etc., etc.

read some of the vr book on the market:

	- virtual realiti - ken piment and ken texiera (sp?)
	- virtual mirag
	- artifici realiti - myron kreuger
	- etc.
