a develop surfac is s.t. you can lai it (or roll it) flat on the
plane (it mai requir you to give it a "cut" though...)

e.g., a cylind, a cone, a plane (of cours!) or ani surfac or patch
have vanish gaussian (intrins) curvatur (i.e., with singular
hessian, the matrix of 2nd deriv for an adequ coordin patch)
ar "develop". in more technic word, a develop surfac is
"local isometr to a plane" at all point.


think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-develop:
whatev wai(s) you cut it, you will not be abl to lai flat ani piec
of it... (it intrins curvatur is nowher vanish).

for more detail on thi look at ani book on differenti geometri
which treat surfac (2d manifold); e.g., m. do carmo's book:

@book{carmo76differenti,
  author =      {do carmo, manfredo p.},
  titl =       {differenti geometri of curv and surfac},
  year =        1976,
  publish =   {prentic-hall},
  note =        {503 page.}}

enjoi!
