i have a 486sx25 comput with a 105 mg seagat id drive and a control  
built into the motherboard. i want to add a scsi drive (a quantum prodriv  
425f 425 mg format). i have no document at all and i need your  
help!

as i understand it, here is the process of ad such a drive.  could you  
pleas tell me if i'm right..

1- bui a scsi contol.  which on? i know adaptec is good, but thei ar  
kind of expens.  ar there ani good board in the $100 region? i want  
it to be compat with os2 and unix if possibl.  also, i have seen on  
the net that there ar scsi and scsi2 drive. is thi true? doe the  
adapt need to be the same as the drive? what type of drive is the  
quantum?

2- connect the drive to the adapt via a scsi cabl and the power cabl.
do i have to worri about the power suppli? i think i have 200 watt and  
all i'm power ar two floppi and the seagat drive.

3- setup the bio to recogn the drive as the second drive.  what type  
of drive is thi? i don't have the number for thi drive.

4- format and creat partit on the drive. do i us format or fdisk? i  
think that id drive can't be low-level format. is it the same with  
scsi? how exactli doe fdisk work? i have a reduc msdo 5.0 manual  
(clone oblig) and there is no mention of fdisk.  ideal, i would want  
the drive partit in to two partit d: and e: how do i do thi?

well that seem to be all. is there anythi i'm forget? 
ani help is *realli* appreci, i'm lost...
