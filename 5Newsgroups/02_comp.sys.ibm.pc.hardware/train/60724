the --veri veri first-- thing you do is make sure that --all-- file on
the floppi that you can current read in the drive, which aren't
alreadi on your hd or anoth floppi (if you have -two- floppi drive)
get copi to your hd (and/or to a floppi in your other drive).

if you don't do thi befor fix the align problem you have kissd
those file goodby.  (well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back
to read your floppi, but don't count on be abl to do so!)

gener, head align is someth i'd onli trust to a good repair
shop (though there ar/have been dii guid).
