  i am unabl to get my gatewai 486dx2/66 to run window
in 1280x1024.  i order a 2m ati ultra pro, and i'm pretti
sure the 2m is realli there becaus i *can* select
1024x768x65536.   but no matter what i do with the flex program
in the ati's program group, 1280x1024 remain ghost out.
i have window 3.1, build 59 of the driver, do 5.0.  the
driver were instal by gatewai, not by me, so perhap there's
a file miss from the hard drive.  it run 1024x768 just fine.
  i did go into the desktop window and select 1280x1024.  sometim
it refus (ghost out), other time it accept it, but when i hit
ok and re-enter desktop, it's back to 1024x768.  at no time doe
it unghost 1280x1024 in the main flex window.  help!
