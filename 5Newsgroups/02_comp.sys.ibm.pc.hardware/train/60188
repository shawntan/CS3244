thi might be a silli question but i have to ask it anywai. i am in
the process of purchas an eisa/vl bu 486 dx2-66 comput and i
found two place that sell machin that have what i want and have the
same price. the first is ar and thei us a cach motherboard (that's
the brand of the motherboard) with opti chip set, the other is micron
(formerli edg technolog) and thei us the micron eisa/vlb
motherboard.

i said that thi might be a silli question sinc i believ that
micron is a veri well known motherboard manufactur while i never
heard of cach! i am howev lean toward the ar machin becaus
my impress is that thei ar known for build good, solid machin
and thei have good tech support (24 hr, 7 dai/wk), and a better
warrante (2 year).  micron, on the other hand, seem to have
recent aquir edg technolog and i'm not sure how much i should
trust the compani.

i would realli appreci ani input on thi. is the micron machin the
clear choic?  doe anyon know anyth posit or neg about
either compani? ha anyon ever heard of cach motherboard? should i
go with micron just becaus it ha the micron motherboard? etc.

thank veri much in advanc for ani inform.
