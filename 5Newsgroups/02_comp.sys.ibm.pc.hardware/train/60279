hi netter!

i'm look at purchas some sort of backup solut.  after you read about
my situat, i'd like your opinion.  here's the scenario:

1.  there ar two comput in the hous.  on is a small 286 (40mb id drive).
    the other is a 386dx (213 scsi drive w/ adaptec 1522 control).  both 
    system have pc tool and will us central point backup as the backup / 
    restor program.  both system have 3.5" and 5.25" floppi.

2.  the comput ar not network (nor will thei be anytim soon).

from what i have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possibl
solut (i'm sure there ar other i haven't thought about).  for these 
option, i would appreci hear from anyon who ha tri them or see 
ani flaw (drive type x won't coexist with devic y, etc.) in my think 
(i don't know veri much about these beast):

1.  put 2.88mb floppi drive (or a combin drive) on each system.
    can someon suppli cost and brand inform?  what's a good brand?
    what do the floppi themselv cost?


2.  put an intern tape backup unit on the 386 us my scsi adapt, and
    continu to back up the 286 with floppi.  again, can someon recommend a
    few manufactur?  the onli brand i rememb is colorado memori.  ani
    happi or unhappi user (i know about the compress controversi)?
 

3.  connect an extern tape backup unit on the 386 us my scsi adapt, and
    (mayb?) connect it to the 286 somehow (ani suggest?)


4.  instal a floptic drive in each machin.  again, ani gotcha's or 
    recommend for manufactur?  

i appreci your help.  you mai either post or send me e-mail.  i will
summar all respons for the net.

thank,

georg
