howdi,

sorri if thi ha been cover befor:

on of my pc illiter friend ask me to help him instal drdo 6.0 on hi
nec powerm sx (386sx 16).  of cours, i said "no problem" and went to work.
unfortun, the drdo refus to recogn the hard drive dure 
instal, even though i am still abl to boot off of the hard drive us
the old do.  after open it up i discov it wa us an 8-bit 
seagat scsi control on a st-157n scsi 40mbtye drive.  i then boot 
with drdo 6.0 off of the floppi a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
i could access the drive.  lo and behold the primari 46.5 mbyte partit 
wa intact (creat by do 3.1 no less, i didn't think you could go over a
32mbyte partit in the older dose. i could be wrong...).  i then tri 
to remov the primari partit, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  i am 
unawar of anyth special that ha to be done with a scsi drive (i 
kinda expect it to work just like an id/mfm/rll drive for do 
instal).  ani suggest would be greatli appreci (except for 
"throw it in the garbag and bui a new pc")...

thank in advanc,
