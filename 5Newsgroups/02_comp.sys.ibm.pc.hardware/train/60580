b(>i am interest in get the puls of thi group regard
b(>extend oper of my g2k 486-33v with the cover remov
b(>from the enclosur.  there ar a # of reason i am consid
b(>thi, includ quick access to jumper dure complex i/o card
b(>setup.

b(>my concern is that without a complet enclosur to direct the
b(>cool flow of air from the fan, "hot spot" mai develop on my
b(>motherboard or elsewher.

if you have an adequ suppli of air move over the system (most
offic or home have posit ventil) you can gener run a
system without the cover for extend period without a problem. (i'm
talk about complet remov the cover - not just leav the slot
uncov.) howev, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
is rf sheild. oper a system without the full cover mai creat
problem with other equip such as your neighbor's tv or ham radio
station - veri much a no-no in the ey of the law.
