i am try to get my system to work with a tandberg 3600 + futur
domain tmc-1660 + seagat st-21m mfm control. 

the system boot up if the tandberg is disconnect from the system,
and of cours no scsi devic found (i have no other scsi devic).

the system boot up if the seagat mfm control is remov from the
system. the futur domain card report find the tandberg 3660 on
the scsi bu. the system then of cours stop boot becaus my mfm
hard disk can't be found.

the system hang if all three (tandberg, futur domain tmc-1660 &
seagat mfm control) ar in the system. 

look like there is some conflict between the seagat and futur
domain card. but the funni thing is that it onli hang if the tandberg
is connect.

i have check that there ar no conflict in bio address, irq & i/o
port. have i miss anyth?

i am lost here. ani suggest ar most welcom. thank in advanc.

delman.
