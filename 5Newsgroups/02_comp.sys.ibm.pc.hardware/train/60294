(how is 0-40 twice 1.25? do you just pick whatev scsi setup that make
the statment "correct"?)
even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that esdi and id (i includ scsi and ata) ar
complet differ (esdi is devic-level, like mfm/rll).

great, you can compar two number (ata ha sever speed mode, by the
wai) but what the articl said wa mislead/wrong.

i would recommend peopl call the ncr board and download the ansi spec
if thei ar realli interest in thi stuff.

someth is miss there. :) anywai, i agre. there's a lot of
opportun for market jingo like "scsi-2 compliant" which tell
you noth about the perform, whether it ha "wide" support, etc.

what doe it us? hopefulli a good ncr chip (e.g. 53c710)
