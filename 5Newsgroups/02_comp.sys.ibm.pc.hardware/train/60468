unfortun there a *lot* of such softwar.  i also find it to be
the case that the major of the softwar that is bad in thi regard
is commerci softwar.  wai too mani commerci packag ar veri
poorli written.  but then most of the program in ms-do ar crap, such
as the print command tsr that lock up your system for long period of
time when the printer is full instead of try everi clock tick.

back to comm softwar... i find success with telix (my com3 at 3e8/5
work ok on telix).
