i just purchas a viewson 17 and and orchid p9000.  in short, i am happi
with the monitor and unhappi with the card.  i have spent a lot more time
futz with the card, so that is what i am go to write about.  the monitor
is pretti.  the moir i had under simciti on my 17" magnavox went awai.  it
isn't as heavi as i thought it would be (45 lb, i think).  so much for the
monitor.  on to the bitch session and test result.

in go with the modern trend, the orchid p9000 card onli support 16 color
in 640x480 mode without a driver.  of cours, thi break ani do program
which us svga mode (like most of my cd-rom).  the compudyn whiplash vga,
orchid fahrenheit 1280, and orchid f. vlb all share thi limit.  those
ar all s3 card, which mean it is an s3 problem for them (the p9000 us
a weitek vga chip which also doesn't support them).  the hercul graphit
card doe seem to have these mode, but i didn't run the same test case as
i did on the other board dure the brief time i had it.  it wa abl to
print the splash screen for the grolier's encyclopedia, though, which the s3
card just print as hash, which is why i suspect the svga mode ar support.

the support resolut realli annoi me.  you can do 1280x1024 at 75hz if
you tell the driver you have an nec 5fg (thei onli have about six monitor
list plu 'gener', and if you choos gener you can't get ani high
refresh at all).  but at 1024x768 you ar limit to 70hz.  seem to me
that the hardwar should be abl to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75hz
at 1280 it sure should be abl to do it at 1024!).  higher vertic resolut
wa the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f. vlb i current have,
and it will do 1024x768x70 hz as well.

the higher graphic mode all crash hp dashboard.  i just got off the phone
with orchid, and with the 1.1 driver (i don't know what i have) he wa unabl
to recreat the problem.  on the plu side, their tech rep wa as help as
he could be and boot up the program on hi comput to verifi he didn't have
the problem.  he didn't know why thei limit the refresh to 70 hz either.

the board is faster that the ofvlb for most thing accord to the hercul
speedi program. thi program test variou oper and report the result
in pixel/second.  i don't have the number for the graphit card, but thei
were close to half of the ofvlb (ie, slower) but that wa run in a 20mhz
386, isa, so the number aren't realli compar.  the follow number
were all obtain us a 486, 33 mhz, air motherboard (umc chipset), with
8 mb memori.  i give rang becaus the program report the number as it
comput them, and these tend to jump around a bit.


k mean thousand (not 1024), m mean million, pixel per second

the dib to screen test take a devic independ bitmap of a face and transfer
it to the screen.  i have no idea what is be done intern as far as
convers go.  the memori to screen take the same face and copi it to
the screen, my guess is after it ha been raster into a bitmap that can
just be copi to the video displai.  the screen to screen test copi that
face from place to place on the screen.  awesom!  interestingli, the solid
vector and shade polygon show no improv, and hatch polygon (ie,
fill with cross-hatch) and ternari rop (whatev thei ar.  graphic
oper like xor mayb????) ar a dead loss on the 9000.  i give two
number for the 9000 font, becaus i think thei ar cach.
when the font ar first drawn on the screen thei ar done fairli slowli --
1/3 the speed of the ofvlb.  then the speed increas dramat.  sound
like program to a benchmark to me....

i make no claim that these number mean anyth at all.  it just what
i saw when i ran them on my comput.  i normal don't write disclaim,
but thi time mayb i'd better.  my test is total unconnect with my
work (i program under unix on decstat) is done complet without the
knowledg, bless, or equip of my compani.
