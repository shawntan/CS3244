hi.  i am try to set up a conner 3184 and a quantum 80at drive.  i have
the conner set to the master, and the quantum set to the slave (doesn't work
the other wai around).  i am abl to access both drive if i boot from a 
floppi, but the drive will not boot themselv.  i am run msdo 6, and
have the conner partit as primari do, and is format with system
file.  i have tri all differ type of setup, and even chang id
control card.  if i boot from a floppi, everyth work great (except
the boot part :)).  the system doesn't report an error messag or anyth,
just hang there.  doe anyon have ani suggest, or ha somebodi els
