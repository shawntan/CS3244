don't believ everyth you ar told.  i can tell you that mix them 
between 'bank' ok, and i can't see why mix in on bank is not unless 
thei ar of differ speed ( e.g. mix of 60ns and 100ns simm in on 
bank ).  the two onli differ in the type of chip it us.  assum that 
the simm ar 1mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equival 
configur.  the 3-chip simm us two 4-bit wide 4mbit (1m of 4-bit 
nibbl ) and on 1-bit wide 1mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1mbyte 
).  the 9-bit simm us nine 1-bit wide 1mbit chip.  these ar equival 
becaus of the wai that it is 'pin' on the simm board.  at the simm 
interfac, thei both act as 9-bit wide 1mbyte simm ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorri 
if too techi for ya].

that sound correct.  the problem is that if your comput take 9-bit 
wide simm, you can not mix differ size in on bank.  why you ask?  
simpl,  if you understand why there is bank.  assum you have a 32-bit 
cpu ( 386dx or 486 ), the data bu (e.g. the mechan to retriev data 
from memori ) is 32-bit wide, so the comput expect to see 32 bit when 
it ask for data.  to get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard 
link 4 1mx9 ( on bit is not data, but pariti, so i will ignor that in 
thi simpl explain ) to get 32bit [ (9-1)*4=32 bit ].  that mean 
that a simm in a bank store onli 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  if you 
have a 16-bit bu, two 1mx9 simm ar link togeth to get 16-bit wide 
data, which is the reason why 286 bank ar 2 simm wide, and 32-bit bank 
ar 4 simm wide.  if your comput requir 1mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data 
with 4 pariti bit, us in some ps/2s and ast ), you could upgrad by 
on simm at a time.

hope that thi messag is not over your head, but the answer to your 
question wa not simpl.  i could of just said, 'becaus i said so.'
