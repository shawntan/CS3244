on wai to get the system go with on floppi drive and on hard
disk on a 63 watt power suppli is to first disconnect the power from
the floppi drive than turn on the pc, you will notic the hard drive
have a real difficult time get up to speed, but it manag.
when boot is finish, plug in your floppi drive, now it will work.

(ok i know thi is not veri user friendli, mayb you ar better off
bui a 486-66 with 300 watt power suppli or someth like that)
