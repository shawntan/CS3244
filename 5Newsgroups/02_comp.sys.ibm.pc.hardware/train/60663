i had thi problem some time ago.  some bios do not automat instal 
com3 or com4 in the port tabl. program like most modem program which 
write directli to the port work fine but anyth that us a bio call 
fail. find a bb or ftp site where you can get a copi of port finder. put 
"devic=pf.sy" in your config.sy or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
thi littl program will locat all exist port and make sure the bio 
tabl ar updat. it work great. pf will also let you swap port and 
such also if that is of ani valu to you.
