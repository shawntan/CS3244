i receiv a kaypro 286i comput (do) without a manual that 
describ the jumper on the motherboard.  it came with
640kb and i up'd it to 1mb.  but the comput or setup doe not
recogn the extra 384k.

on the main board and what jumper ar requir to expand it to 1mb?

some spec:
	kaypro main board assi number 81-621
