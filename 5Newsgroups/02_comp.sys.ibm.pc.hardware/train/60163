we have a gatewai 486dx50 with a smc elit16 seri ethercard plu.

when we us ncsa ftp to send from the gatewai with hash turn on, we see
4 hash mark immedi.  then the comput  r e a l l y  drag.  if we turn 
off the intern cach of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match
the speed when we receiv to the gatewai.

it doesn't matter if we send from the gatewai or get to it: 4 hash mark and 
then extrem slow if the cach is not disabl.

doe anyon know ani more about thi?  is there a fix?

the gatewai wa purchas in june, 1992.

pleas respond directli.  you wouldn't believ how slow the new is on thi 
system.   

thank.
