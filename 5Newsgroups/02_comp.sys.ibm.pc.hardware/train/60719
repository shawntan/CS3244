i'm in the market to upgrad my bio to a phoenix 1.10 (got a new hard disk,
discov my bio doesn't have a "type 47") and i would like know where i
can purchas on of these thing.

i check with the motherboard manufactur (for the curiou-- it's from
mylex), and hear the $60 figur prompt me to at least try to shop
around...

problem is, i don't know where to shop around for someth like thi.

i have heard that there's a bio special shop in the south bai and it's
been alleg that thei advertis in the microtim.

did find the microtim, didn't find the ad or the shop.

so, can anybodi help me out on thi quest?
