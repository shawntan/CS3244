you'll probabl get on when you realiz that your $100 vesa super
dooper local bu ultra high tech control suck...

have you ever seen what happen when you hook a busmast control to
a vesa local bu.  it actual  slow down your system

mayb my workstat doesn't understand what your vesa local bu
id is

vesa local bu will be kill off by pcmi? whatev intel spec is.
vlbu it not good for much more than vga card.

to each hi own.  i'll laugh when you start cry over how much you
spent for your 2 littl id drive and then find out you need more
space.

don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know
noth about.


i'd rather wait a second compar to the 5 minut and id would take.
(obvious exagger).

have you ever tri to backup 2 gig of disk?  oh i forgot you can't
becaus you have an id and no on make id disk that big.

i guess you probabl bought a 486sx too

what?  the scsi-2 fast,wide spec ha much more bandwidth than ani stupid
vlbu id crap....

stop thi thread now, it just clutter up bandwidth.  if you want
to read about scsi vs id just pai a visit to you local usenet archiv.

the best scsi-2 fast,wide,etc is clearli faster than ani the best id drive.
all the respons given ar base upon person experi with 1 or 2
drive.  you can't judg such complet differ interfac.  
id ha the low cost adavantag + a descent perform.
scsi ha the abil for super high capac expand and speed.

neither on is better in all case.

if you don't beliv what i said about busmast and vlbu then pick
up a back issu of pc-week in whihc thei test vlbu, eisa and isa
busmast card.

send flame to /dev/null.....
