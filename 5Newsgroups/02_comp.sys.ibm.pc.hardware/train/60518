yeah, there is absolut no us for vlb except for video graphic.
and no id could possibl take advantag the vlb, becaus it run at
8 mhz and 16 bit. do peopl forget that the id wa specif
design to interfac directli with the at isa bu? we've seen
id come out for eisa, xt isa, and now even mca, but at all time
it wa a 16 bit standard, run at somewher near 8-10 mhz. when
you run an id off of the vlb, there's no wai that you're run it
at 33 mhz, it would burn up. of cours same goe for scsi, esdi, whatev,
none of them run at cpu speed.

the onli wai to gain advantag with a vlb id is to hook it up to
a cach control. i suspect it would be much, much better to
get a softwar disk cach instead, sinc you get write-cach as well.

>becaus you have an id and no on make id disk that big.

i've seen some fuji id drive go as high as 1g.
