while other here mai have had better experi, i, too, share the
sentiment post abov.  though i have the origin stealth/vram,
it is onli "rel" recent that the window driver for thi card
have evolv to a point of decent perform.  note that there ar
still a coupl of mode i cannot us (ie. will not) due to shadow,
mi-drawn check box, etc.  i believ the version i have is 2.01.
if there's a more recent releas, i'd appreci if someon would
drop me a note to let me know -- i haven't been abl to get on their
bb late to check again.  natur, diamond doesn't even bother
notifi me of fix/releas.

diamond wa help when i final reach the "right" person in cure
some of my window' problem due to an address conflict.  the conflict
address (2e0, 2e8) were omit in at least my version of the
diamond/vram manual.  i hope it ha been correct by now.  the tech rep
explain that all s3-base board us these address.  i have not
confirm the valid of that statement.

when i upgrad my motherboard in the near futur (hopefulli with some
form of local bu), i'll seek a video solut from someon other than
diamond.
