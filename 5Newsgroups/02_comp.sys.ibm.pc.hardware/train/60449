14.4 modem that us the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem.

to a specif brand us the rockwel, or is it the rockwel
chipset itself?  and, if it is the rockwel chipset, what 
ar the chanc that if i bui on of these modem (us the
rockwel chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a rom
chang will fix/compens for the bug?
