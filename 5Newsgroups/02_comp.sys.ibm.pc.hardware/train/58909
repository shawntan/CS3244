  time, for no obviou reason spin down complet (on can
  tell by the sound) and simpli refus to be access. do
  react with an error (drive d: cannot be access or
  someth the like). unfortun, i cannot just reproduc
  the error. sometim it occur more often, sometim
  less. the last time it happen wa when i want to 
  demonstr some softwar to a colleagu.
    i would like to know if anybodi ha experienc similar
  problem. i don't like to take the thing to the dealer
  onli to be told that there's noth wrong with it. i

  differ configur.
