i have a 5 1/4" drive as drive a.  how can i make the system boot from
my 3 1/2" b drive?  (optim, the comput would be abl to boot
from either a or b, check them in order for a bootabl disk.  but
if i have to switch cabl around and simpli switch the drive so that
it can't boot 5 1/4" disk, that's ok.  also, boot_b won't do the trick
for me.)

thank,
  davebo
