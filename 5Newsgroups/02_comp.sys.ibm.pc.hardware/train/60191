	you got sucker in the same wai i did.  silli me, believ
	that the "250" logo on the front meant actual carri capac.
	the peopl who do thi sort of thing for a live call it 
	"market."  lawyer who prosecut it call it "fraud."
	perhap we can have a bunch of other dupe buyer march on 
	their corpor headquart.

	thi is a bit long.  my system take about 45 minut to do 
	the same thing.  usual 4.5 hour, particularli if the tape 
	is grind awai the whole time mean that your block size for 
	the write is too small.  is there ani wai to chang the block 
	size or write buffer size so it's bigger?

	thi is becaus the file ar open by do.  the file in the 
	tape directori ar like the execut file or the configur
	file for the tape system.  i would recommend run the backup
	from do so it will make a complet backup of the tape directori.

	the 250mb cartridg won't do you ani good sinc the drive
	won't write 250mb of physic data on the tape.
