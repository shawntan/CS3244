i just talk to a rep for my at&t mastercard regard thi:  there is no
maximum claim, and you onli have to notifi them of the warranti when the 
item need repair.  if it can't be repair, you get the amount you paid
for it.
curious though, the at&t gold mastercard ha a limit of $1000 on claim.
definit not upgrad to that card...:)
