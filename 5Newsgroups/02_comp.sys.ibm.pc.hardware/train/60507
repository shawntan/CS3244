just taken deliveri of a 66mhz 486 dx2 machin, and veri nice it is too.
on queri - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or someth mhz
- that not the problem. the problem is the speed when turbo is off. it
7 mhz. the equival in car term is have a nice porsch with a button
that turn it into a skateboard.

doe anyon have a clue as to what determin the rel perform of
turbo vs non-turbo?? i would like to set it to give a landmark speed of
about 30 or 40 mhz with turbo off.

cheer,
