it depend on what you'd like your joystick for.  i've seen gravi
joystick at radio shack.  thei seem flimsi and didn't fit well in my
hand.  i have heard on c.s.i.p.game that thei don't last well (less than
a year) on flightsim.  on redeem featur doe seem to be the abil
to adjust the tension of the stick.

i recent purchas a ch flightstick.  there aren't ani suction cup and
no tension adjust but otherwis it seem to be an excel joystick. 
i'm current us it for the wing command seri and red baron.  work
quit well.  the larg base doe not requir a steadi hand and so
leav it free.  the button provid good tactil respons (you can hear
and feel them well).  there ar other model made by ch that can go up or
down in featur.

for price comparison gravi analogu joystick sell for ~$35.00 here
compar to the $45.00 i paid for a ch flightstick.  i think the extra
$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it befor you bui.

just anoth note, analogu joystick ar best for flightsim or someth
that need sensit touch.  if you're onli plai game such as castl
wolfenstein or some other game that onli us digit input (ie. onli up,
down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into
a gravi gamepad.  thei look like a nintendo control pad but i don't know
much beyond that.
