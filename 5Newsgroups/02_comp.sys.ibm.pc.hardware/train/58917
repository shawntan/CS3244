you shouldn't have troubl.  i have heard of machin have problem 
with slower than recommend memori speed, but never faster.  

bk>also, is it possibl to plug in simm of differ
bk>speed into the same motherboard?  ie - 2 meg of 70ns and 2 meg of 6
bk>or someth like that?

sure.  i have 4 70ns simm in on bank and 4 60ns simm in the other ( i 
have a 486 ).  i wouldn't recommend mix speed within a bank, just to 
be on the safe side.
