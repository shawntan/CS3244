yeah.  sound typic.  window make all sort of extra demand on hardwar,
and therefor your machin can't keep up with thing.  ever notic how when
acess the floppi in window, everyth els slow to a crawl?  i 
imagin your backup and evertyh els that is run fight for cpu time,
and sometim the backup program lose.  be glad.  i can't even run in 
medium speed with cp backup on my machin, supposedli becaus i have a scsi
machin which place extra demand on the data bu.
