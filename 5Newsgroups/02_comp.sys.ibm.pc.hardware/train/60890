i wa have major memori problem a few month ago.
get pariti error - system halt error messag in window.
i ran qa/plu, check it, diagnos, as well as sever sharewar
memori checker. i had a total of 8 meg simm in my system.
these store bought/ sharewar memori diagnost either ran fine
without error or found an error at some address that i couldn't
place on a memori chip. out of exahper i came up with
the (now delet) step to find bad memori chip. i found 2
(moral : never bui memori stamp "not for sensit or critic 
applic" on the back.
        anywai i did filter out all the bad memori chip us 
combin of 4 of the 8 meg chip and creat a ram drive to
test on. although it dodn't allevi my pariti error problem
in window. i did manag to find bad memori chip in thi manner
it ha never fail to find a bad chip for me. and the commerci/
sharewar have alwai faild me either not find the error or
point to an addreww which i have no idea on what chip it is.

p.s. man my type stink todai and i don't feel like futz around with 
thi line editor.
