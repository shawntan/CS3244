comput: 286-25 mhz
bu: isa (12.5 mhz)
drive: maxtor 7213a (213 mb)

core (v 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec
norton si (v 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec

i'd still like to here from peopl with vlb-id.
i still want to know what vlb bu speed is us with id drive.
i still want to know if some (most ?) id drive can handl bu speed > 8 mhz.

ps: a friend with a 286-20 and a new maxtor 7245 (245 meg id) drive get
between 800 - 1000 k/sec (can't rememb exactli).  i think the bu is run
at 8 mhz in thi case.
