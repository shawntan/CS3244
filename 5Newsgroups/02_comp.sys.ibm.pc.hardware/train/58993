    ^^^
how long doe he have to take in fix it?  doe he have to us new
part when he repair it or can he substitut us part without your
knowledg?  can he charg you for repair that should be under warranti
but he claim ar due to improp mainten on your part? 

when it come to local dealer:

- have fun get consist good support.  most of their "tech" ar
re-tread salesmen, not train technician, with a high turnov rate.

- have fun get in-warranti work done quickli and courteous.

- have fun get out-of-warranti work done cheapli, or even done
period, unless you ar on a paid servic contract.

have been both a servic technician, and a servic manag, at a
computerland franchis and anoth retail comput place, i know what
i'm talk about. 

i also know the "local servic" scam that retail comput dealer like
to push when thei're sell.  it's that same old song that car dealer
have been sing for year -- "bui from me and you'll get good
servic. we alwai treat our custom right!  bui from my competit
and you'll be sorri if you need servic." 

experienc mail order buyer know that there ar some mail order
compani that give excel servic, includ overnight replac part, 
on-site call, etc. there ar probabl some local dealer that can give you
good servic, too. but if you think all local dealer give consistenli good 
servic, you ar wrong.  i have mani anectdot to prove my point, 
but i'm sure there ar other on the net can do a better job than i can.
