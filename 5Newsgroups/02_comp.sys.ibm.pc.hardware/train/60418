   try put on of the irq for your com port onto irq2. the hardwar will
automag wrap irq2 to irq9 on at class machin (eg, anyth with high
irq). thi is what i'm do on my set up right now. 
   i've got com2 on irq2 (realli irq9 - address it thi wai in softwar), com1
on irq3, soundblast on irq5, lpt1 on irq7, and my ati busmous port on on of
the interrupt in between. work just great.
   if you need even more, there's a text file float around somewher that
detail how to hack up ani serial card (and probabl ani other) to work on the
higher irq. it basic involv cut the trace to the low irq and run a wire over the a high irq pin on the 16bit expans bu.

  it will be best to put the modem's com port onto irq2/9. thi will be the 

first irq servic by the system, give the modem a better respons -- 
especi handi under multitask like os/2 -- which i'm run with no
problem.
