these question can be answer by ani dealer of ibm valu point, but, i will
provid some unsolicit advic -- the most amus kind of advic.

todai (tuedai 4-6-93) ibm is suppos to offici announc the introduct
of the vesa local bu valu point system.  these system still have on-board
video and disk which ar far better than the prior valu point system, and
you get vesa local bu for (futur?) upgrad.  we ar go to bui three of
them with 17" monitor (also a newli avail), and on of the three will
immedi be upgrad to ultrastor 34f cach scsi disk control and
either the ati gup or the viper graphic board.

do not bui a 486sx sytem.

my person philosophi on upgrad polici is that it is not loss-free.  when
you earn monei you pai tax, when you spend monei you pai tax.  (i.e. thei
get you come and go).  translat thi mean take infrequ but larg
step.  you ar far better off short term and long term if you avoid the sx
model and go straight to the dx or dx-2 model.
