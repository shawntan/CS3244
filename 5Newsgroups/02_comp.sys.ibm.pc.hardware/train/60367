then don't complain (mayb it wasn't you) that scsi wa so expens on
pc's becaus all we've had until a year or two ago wa the isa bu.
(ie no on bui scsi for isa becaus isa is slow)
ar you sai that scsi on an isa bu is not an automat winner when
compar to id?

i get differ transfer rate out of my id when i chang my isa bu speed.

id is just a variant of the old ibm- mfm at control.  (at least that's
how it look from a softwar point of view).  it wa never meant to be
an all-encompass protoc/standard to be impliment across differ
platform.

is there ani argument that 
id can (or can't) transfer data from the id drive at least as fast as the
drive is abl to provid the data?  ar scsi version of id drive abl
to deliv higher sustain transfer rate to their scsi interfac (becaus
of a higher rpm platter, differ arrang of head, etc?)?

if data is go from on drive to anoth, and if scsi ha the abil to
perform that transfer without the data have to go through the cpu or main
memori, then ye, that is the optim wai to do it.  as far as i know, id
can't do that.  but when the cpu want data from both drive (data to be store
in main memori) ar you sai that scsi can grab data from both drive 
at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memori also at the
same time?  work off 1 irq and 1 dma channel on an isa (or whatev) bu?

a friend of mine just got a maxtor 245 meg id drive for $320.  (that's 245
million byte, or 234 mega-byte).  with the basic $20 interfac, he get
close to 1 meg/sec transfer on hi 286-20.  doe your figur includ a few
hundr $$$ for scsi driver?

so you're sai that scsi would have been the default interfac type,
consid that the vast major of pc's don't have cd-rom drive or
tape backup or etc?  that most pc's onli have (or had) 1 hard drive and
run do?  that scsi hard drive cost a lot more than mfm or rll drive
at the time?  (and how common were scsi drive under 80 meg 4 to 10 year
ago?)  there's a lot more than the lack of a common interfac card that
prevent scsi from becom the connect medium of choic.

but on that point, is it faster?  thi is what all thi is about.  do you
get more perform for the monei.  for all the peopl that will onli have
a singl hard drive in their system (regardless of the os) will the scsi
choic realli give them more perform than id?

true, but expand can also start on the bu, which mean the option
is there for cd-rom drive or tape backup that run off their own card.

no argument.  thi is alwai held up to the first time scsi buyer as the
best reason.  but how mani scsi devic will the first time scsi buyer
eventu acquir?  again doe it make sens to go scsi for a singl
hard drive system?

with all the post on the scsi i or ii spec, ar you realli sure that
pc and appl scsi hard drive ar compat?  and even if thei ar, 
is the data access from either machin (ie ar there no format/
partit or file tabl differ?)  is it realli plug'n'plai?

so the c: drive on the connor becom a logic d: drive to do.  is thi
realli a problem?

after have two id drive in my system for temporari file transfer,
i have never seen ani differ when switch between drive, nor
have i ever seen ani differ when transfer file between drive or
to/from the same drive.

that is nice (as long as the power suppli can keep up).  i do believ that
there is the possibl for up to 4 id drive on a pc.

>simpli put, scsi is handier than id.  no mysteri jumper to figur out.

but what about "mysteri" (and expens) driver to figur out?  at least
id doesn't requir driver that consum preciou convent (do) memori.
