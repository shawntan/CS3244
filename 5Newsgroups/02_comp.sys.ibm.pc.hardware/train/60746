is it possibl to bui a serial i/o card with the 16550 uart's built in
(rather than have to bui them separ, and socket them in)?

my current i/o card us 8250's (correct number? the braindead on anywai).
it also control two floppi drive, and two id hard drive.

ideal, i'd like to get a new multi i/o card, that had 2 serial port with
16550's and could also control anoth 2 id hd's. it would have to have
configur address for both the serial port, and the id control, so
it could co-exist with my exist card.

doe such a beast exist? now the hard part - where can i get on in australia,
prefer brisban?

thank,
