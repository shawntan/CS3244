if your gatewai is equip with a western hard drive, then the nois
is probabl come from there and not from the fan.  the western drive
ar notori noisi.  on the other hand, if you don't have a western
drive, then mayb it is the fan.  there's not alot to do about it except
insul around the cpu somehow.
