we ar try to connect an olivetti xm4311 5" floppi drive as the second
drive on a panason 286 machin.  it seem to sort of talk to it (get it
spin and step) but give a "disk not readi" error.

there ar two jumper (which seem to work best open), a 3 posit dip
switch, and a 8 posit dip switch.  we don't know how to set the dip
switch and think that mai be the problem.

ani inform, or advic (other than "junk the stupid thing" :) would be
most appreci, thank.  (email repli prefer).
