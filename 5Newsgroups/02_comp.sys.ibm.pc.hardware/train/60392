as i said thi is sloppi and dumb {you should resound by discount the mac
not give "maxtor 245 meg id drive for $320" exampl.  by give an
exampl you give the impli consent that for mac info to be includ
in the scsi discus.}

ok i will do thi v e r y  s l o w l y so you can understand
reguardless of whether it is a mac or a pc scsi-1 and scsi-2 ar differ
from each other as is asynchron and synchron scsi-1.  all of these
have differ speed and cost. lump them all togeth as 'scsi' is
dumb and sloppi.  take again the quot later on as an exampl of the problem 
in the pc world {the spec list wa so that you knew where the number were
come from in the articl.  it show the articl is correct in it
stament about scsi but not consit}.

>thi isin't comp.periph.scsi.
with the wai thi thread ha gone how do you tell :-).

alreadi gave them.  you keep delet them! so here ar the spec
on everybodi again {with some ad info}:

scsi-1 {scsi-1 control chip} asynchron rang: 0-3mb/s
 synchron rang: 0-5mb/s  both common to the pc world; differ is
 mainli in softwar not hardwar.

scsi-1 {scsi-2 control chip; also call scsi-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6mb/s with 
10mb/s burst.  thi is advertis as scsi-2 in byte 4/93:159 for the
 pc and at these speed.{not the mac, the pc.}

{i have not seen the follow for either the mac or the pc}
scsi-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst
scsi-2 {32-bit/wide and fast}:     15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst

on the other interfac let dxb132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
>id rang from 0-8.3mb/s.                          
 asynchron rang: 0-5mb/s {infer from byte 4/93:159}
 synchron rang: 0-8.3mb/s.
>esdi is alwai 1.25mb/s (although there ar some non-standard version)

note that i also give the averag through put for scsi-2 which hold true
a mac or ibm/pc clone with the correct hardwar and softwar.
and sinc pc adversiz ar us theoret perform figur why 
cannot we?

with pc articl like the follow it is obviou that the problem is not with
scsi but with the peopl who report it! {like you.}
look at the inconsit us of scsi in the below quot: 
(my comment in {})
"although scsi is twice as fast as esdi,{thi is asynchron scsi-1 with
a scsi-1 chip} 20% faster than id..." {thi is both asynchron scsi-1 with 
a scsi-2 chip and 8-bit scsi-2} pc magazin april 27, 1993:29
the articl is confus, not scsi.  the term is a mess from inconsit us
not becaus the interfac itself is a mess.

scsi mean "the set of scsi interfac compos of scsi-1 and scsi-2"
not 'scsi-1' as some peopl want to us it.

to read consitantli the quot should read:
{asynchron scsi-1 with a scsi-1 chip}
"although asynchron scsi-1 is twice as fast as esdi, on third the 
speed of id..."
or {asynchron scsi-1 with a scsi-2 chip or 8-bit scsi-2}
"although scsi-1 with a scsi-2 chip and 8-bit scsi-2 ar eight time as fast as
esdi, 20% faster than id..."

note the nonus of 'scsi' by itself.  thi elimin ambagu.

if we ar to continu thi thread state clearli which scsi you ar talk 
about scsi-1 or scsi-2 or scsi over all {scsi-1 and scsi-2}.  lump
everyth into scsi as scsi-1 is sloppi, wrong, and dumb.  inconsit
scsi-1 and scsi-2 usag is also a problem.  clean it up now or have
a mess like svga wa sever year ago becaus everybodi and hi uncl
slap 'scsa' an their own monitor intefac {scsi is standar unlik
svga wa year ago except in terminaolog.}
