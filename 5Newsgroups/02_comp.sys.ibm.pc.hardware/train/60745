   you might try ask on on of the comp.sy.ibm.* echo (the best on
mai be comp.sy.ibm.pc.hardwar).  i sai thi becaus the convers
seem more gear toward a pc user want to us that monitor, than
an atari user who alreadi can us the monitor (unless mayb thei
want to realli go wild - convert the monitor to vga, then
us it as a vga monitor with a falcon :-)

   as for graphic card, assum that the atari monitor can be
modifi/adapt to handl vga signal, you should probabl be abl
to us ani vga card (at least with a re around 640x400).  i haven't
tri thi, but that would be my guess...

...you might want to price mono vga monitor anywai - it mai be cheaper
to go that rout than to do the convers; besid, with the falcon and
beyond, vga/svga/multisync monitor will probabl be the wai to go...
