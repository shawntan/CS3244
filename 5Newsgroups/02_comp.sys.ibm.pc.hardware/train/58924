no rumour, ibm's clock tripl chip wa seen in some trade show last
fall (comdex or someth, i wasn't there). all you peopl who ar
drool after thi chip do realiz that it ha no fpu, just like
486sx, that evil market ploi(tm) from intel, don't you? it ha 16k
of intern cach, which probabl is where the save silicon real
estat went. becaus of some contract, ibm is not allow to sell it
486 chip to third parti, so these chip ar unlik to becom
avail in ani non-ibm machin. of cours, noth prevent other
compani from implement a dx3/99, but nobodi hasn't even come out
with a real 486dx (fpu and all) clone yet (although amd soon will).
