some motherboard support vl bu and 50-dx cpu.  there is an option
(bio i think) where addit wait(s) can be ad with regard to
cpu/vl bu transact.  thi slow the cpu down to a rate that give
the vl bu devic(s) time to 'do their thing'.  these particular wait(s)
ar appli when the cpu transact with vl bu devic(s).  you want to
enabl these wait(s) onli if you ar us a 50-dx with vl bu devic.

thi is from read my motherboard manual, and these ar my interpr-
tation.  your mileag mai vari.

strictli speak, vl and 50mhz ar not compat.  and, there is at
least on 'fudg' mechan to physic allow it to work.
