i recent bought an amd 386/40.  the motherboard booklet sai
the board is a "391 wb/h."  i have 4 1x3 simm on board.  the machin
also us a super id i/o card (model pt-604). (of cours niether
the motherboard or the i/o card booklet clearli state who the manufacur
ar) i'm also us a trident 8900c svga card.

	anywai, that's all of the pertin info i can think of.
my problem is that the comput often freez or displai "pariti error --
system halt" messag depend on whether i set the memori pariti error
check to "disabl" or "enabl" in the setup of the bio (make sens).
it ami bio (so it must be an ami board?).

	i just took it back to the dealer and thei replac all of the
simm but i keep get the same error (more frequent now).  it all
work at the dealer and didn't start screw up 'till i got home (figur).

	i've tri to take out all of the simm and even re-insert them
in revers order, make sure that the connect were solid.

	my suspicion jump to thi damn all in on hd control/serial/
parallel/game-port i/o card, or to the motherboard (god forbid).

	can anyon help?

thank, peac,
