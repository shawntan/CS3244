i'm sorri if i'm misunderstand your post, but dram *doe not* have to
be refresh on *each access cycl*.  so cycl time doe *not* have to be
twice the access time *becaus of refresh phase*.

the access time usual mean the delai time from fall edg of raw
address strobe (ra) to data bu driven.

dram access cycl time chart can be roughli shown as follow (some
signal ar intention omit);

addr --<ra><ca>-------<ra><ca>--------- ra=raw address, ca=column address
ra  ~~~~\________/~~~~~\________/~~~~~		~=high, _=low, -=float
ca  ~~~~~~~\_______/~~~~~~\_______/~~~		<..>=driven either h or l
data ---------<valid>--------<valid>---
         |-------+------|
         |-+--|  |
           |     +----------- cycl time
           +---- access time (or ra access time)

ye, the cycl time is more than twice as the access time but *not*
becaus of the refresh phase.  the refresh can be done either as a
trail phase of normal access cycl or as an individu cycl.
