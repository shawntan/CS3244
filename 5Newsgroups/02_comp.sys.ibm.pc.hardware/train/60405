i recent bought a lead edg 80386dx-33 <mini tower case> and everyth
work fine. lead edg seem to be a decent brand and what-not. i would
tend to sai that it is a decent deal. the onli thing you might want to be
wari about is that my l.e. comput ha a back-plane mount motherboard.
ie: the motherboard itself is a card that can be plug in to a backplan.
some peopl don't like these configur. the second thing is that
whoever set up my comput at the factori didn't realli know what thei were
do. the instal window video driver didn't even take advantag of the
svga card/monitor. look forward to configur the system optim
yourself.
