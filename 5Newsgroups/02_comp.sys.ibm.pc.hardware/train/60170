xga or xga-2?  for the origin xga you just need someth that can do
1024x768 at 45/90hz interlac (just tell them "8514 compat" and thei
should get the idea).  for the xga-2, get what you like.  i prefer multi-
sync like the ibm 6319, the nec or even a fix frequenc monitor like
my home viewson 6.  i like the multisync becaus it's easi to run them
in mode like 800x600x64k color noninterlac, or at higher mode like
1360x1024x16.
