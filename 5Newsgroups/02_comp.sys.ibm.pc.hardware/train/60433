that figur (1/4") for imag rotat would seem to be a littl high...
on my nec 5fg the spec call for no greater than 3mm (0.12").

i can't speak for mag innovis but as far as nec is concern, thei ar
adjust to "factori-spec" befor leav the central usa distribut point
(ma) for the eastern canadian market. now, here's the kei: nec *know* that
the >=15" monitor' adjust ar veri sensit to ship over
distanc (with all the bump, rough handl, and such) and therefor
*expect* and (at least in theori) *requir* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjust at the *local* servic centr (bull hn
inform system in toronto) befor sale. thi is the correct and
probabl onli wai of have ani chanc of receiv a "perfect" monitor
(the definit of "perfect" seem to depend on how picki on is, in my
case quit :).

>ar other netter just live with these kind of imperfect?

i, for on, wa not will to accept what i consid a substandard
monitor and, after two month of wrangl and direct contact with nec,
final receiv a satisfactorili adjust monitor (not perfect, imho,
but a major improv over what the dealer and distributor were try
convinc me wa "normal"). the short answer is no, don't accept these
"imperfect" as "normal" becaus for the premium on pai for the
larger screen monitor, on ha a right to expect higher qualiti, and
if you're persist, you'll receiv it.
