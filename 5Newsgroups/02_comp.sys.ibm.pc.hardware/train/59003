i saw in thi month pc or pc world an ad for comput us ibm's 486slc.
so i don't think ibm is restrict in sell their chip, at least not
anymor. a clock-tripl 486, even without coprocessor would be great,
especi with 16k on-board cach. make it 386 pin-compat, and you
have the chip upgrad that dream ar made of :-)
