not completli true.  for at class and later machin, irq5 is
reserv for lpt2.  sinc it's rare to have a second parallel
port in a pc, it's usual a good safe choic if you need an
interrupt.

on the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a gatewai comput (4dx-33v).  it ha a modem on com1,
a mous on com2, and the other serial port wa set to com3 (which
normal us the same interrupt as com1).  we had a real fight
with a board when try to us irq5, and discoverd the problem
wa that gatewai had set it up such that com3 us irq5.  as soon
as we disabl com3, our problem went awai.  grumbl ... after
sever dai of try to figur out why the interrupt didn't work.
