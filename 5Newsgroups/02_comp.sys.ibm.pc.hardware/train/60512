contrari to what other might have thought, i actual did have a scsi drive
onc.  it wa the seagat 296n and the st-02 control.  i found that the
control couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleav, so the best i could do
with the drive wa a 2:1 interleav and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.

i have had that drive/control coexist with mfm, rll, and id drive
becaus the st-02 bio will kinda muscl itself in there with no help
need from the comput's bio.  do will see mani logic drive, much more
than 4 (i've had up to 10).  i've often wonder how mani scsi drive you
could hang off a st-01/02.
