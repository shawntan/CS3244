   as of todai i will no longer be a contact for zeo intern on the net.
thi respons ha been taken over by anoth tech (davidm@zeo.com) and i
am move up and on (mo monei, mo monei :)).  i just want to thank all of the
netter who have support and encourag the particip of zeo on the net.
i person feel it is import for compani such as zeo to provid their
custom with as easi access as possibl when thei have question/problem and
be on the net is an big step in the right direct.  i hope that other
compani will follow suit (as weitek and other have done). again, thank.
