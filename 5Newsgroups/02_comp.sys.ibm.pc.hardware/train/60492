 comput ar a special case.. and it's a pretti good idea to
 leav them on.. cuz everytim you turn on a comput, you're 
 put a surg of electr through it delic compon.
  imagin you're turn on your comput 5 or more time a dai.
 you're increas the chanc of damag the chip, memori,
 etc on all the compon of your comput. so you mai save
 a few cent here and there in electr bill, but it won't
 look like much when it come time to fix your comput.
