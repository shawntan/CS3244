while plai around with my gatewai 2000 local-bu machin last
night, it becam appar that window 3.1 didn't give the option
for 32-bit access for virtual memori.

i am us a perman swap file, and the disk drive is on the local
bu interfac.

is thi expect, or should i be investig further why no 32-bit
option appear?

thank for ani help.
