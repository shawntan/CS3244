thei don't have a conflict becaus technic lpt1: doe not us
irq7!.
     the parallel printer processor (the actual number escap
me) contain a printer control regist which enabl the chip
to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt control as irq7,
then onto the main processor as int 0x0f. by default the parallel
printer processor doe not enabl it's interrupt line therefor
no int 0x0f's will be sourc from the printer control chip,
thu enabl other devic to us the actual irq7.

     note, thi appli to com port also which by default do not
rout interrupt to the system bu, although com's softwar
usual enabl thi featur as it make monitor com port
activ easier than poll the serial uart, thu probabl
get the sound card slighti confus!.

window mai be a differ stori....
