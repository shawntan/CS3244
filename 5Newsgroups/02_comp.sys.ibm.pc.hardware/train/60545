i read an articl about the benefit of a vlb motherboard. it said that a 
true vlb board support bu master, otherwis it is just as good as an isa
motherboard.

doesn't all vlb motherboard support bu master? i just bought a 486-33 vlb
and the tech manual doe not explicitli state the word "local bu master"
but it said it "support bu master and slave mode". ar these term
synonym?

thank.
