hi,

i'm kind of new at the pc stuff.  my machin ha 4 serial port.  com 1 and3
and 2 &4 share same irq.  you mean i can't plug a mous into com1 and a modem
into com3 and expect both to work?

if answer is no, should i chang irq's for com port to be differ?  and,
doe it realli matter which irq i set the port too?
