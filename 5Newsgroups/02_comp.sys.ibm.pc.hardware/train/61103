if you bought your id drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to 
perform a low level format. even if the 1st hd is alreadi partit
into c and d, fdisk will automat assign the 2 nd hd to d and 
chang the 2nd partit of 1st drive to e.

check the jumper set and cmo setup, in particular the correct
number of cylind and track
