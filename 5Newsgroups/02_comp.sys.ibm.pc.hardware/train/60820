i just bought a new id hard drive for my system to go with the on
i alreadi had.  my problem is thi.  my system onli had a id cabl
for on drive, so i had to bui cabl with two drive connector
on it, and consequ have to switch cabl.  the problem is, 
the new hard drive's manual refer to match pin 1 on the cabl
with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the id card.  but
for the life of me i cannot figur out how to tell which wai to plug
in the cabl to align these.  
secondli, the cabl ha like a connector at two end and on between them.
i figur on end goe in the control and then the other two go into
the drive.  doe it matter which i plug into the "master" drive
and which into the "slave"?  ani help appreci.  thank...
