hello all,

you, the net, ar my last resort, or i'll just chang my job :-)
thi might be a faq (e.g. mix control) but haven't seen ani.

sy: 486/33, ami bio, and your run-of-the mill multi-i/o card with
serial/paral/floppi and 
	- id control "clone" gw2760-ex
		there ar no jumper affect the hd or ctrller :-( 
	- quantum prodriv lp (3" 105m type 47: 755cyl, 16hd, 17spt).

pb: i want to bring in thi (2nd hand, neat price):
	- maxtor xt-b380e (~330m, <15ms, bio type 1, ctrller manag
		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hd, 52spt)
	- western digit wd1007v-se1 esdi ctrller: no floppi.
		(jumper set irq 14/15, hw port addr 1f0/170,
		and bio addr cc00/c800, and other floppi/format stuff)

goal: have the wd esdi as a secondari/control and have both disk 
simultan work. be abl to boot from the esdi too would be 
a nice bonu but is not expect.

ultim goal: have room for linux et al.
ex of scheme i have in mind: boot from id (hd or floppi) and mount
the esdi as root. not boot from esdi, or even from hd, is accept.

i have tri numer (all!!) combin to no avail. thei work alon,
or can coexist witout hang-up but can't access the esdi or the id, 
depend on setup/jumper.

us suggest might be:
- how do i tell the bio setup about two ctrller (i guess the 2nd hd
is expect to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- do i need some driver to make it work?
- --- " --- some new bio/chip for ani of these card?
- do i have to bui anoth control to make them hd happi? id
is cheaper; esdi is hard to find and rather costli. i'm not 
rich or i wouldnt' try to scaveng around, so soft sln ar prefer.
- adapt of some sort; i can hold a solder iron, and can chang
a chip or put a jumper!

also us:
- bb or hot-line of western digit.
- ftp archiv with relev info.
- expert store in toronto, ontario area (that would be a miracl! haven't
seen ani realli knowledg ppl in a while)
- ani hint into inner work of the system ... 
- anyth els that help you in similar situat (prayer :-) )

direct or post repli ar ok.
	mani thank,
			cat.
