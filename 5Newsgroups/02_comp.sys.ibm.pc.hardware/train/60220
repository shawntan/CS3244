i have a maxtor 212mb on an isa id control, although my machin is
dx2/66 vlb. i ha the save transfer rate of 0.647 mb/s regardless of
the variat of the isa bu speed. i test it with speed between
5.5mhz and 8.33mhz. not _ani_ differ. the problem is not the
interfac between the control and the memori.

my advic: bui 4meg of ram, save $70 and enjoi perform.
