i am just about to post the result of my big comput purchas.  on
of the kei point wa the abil to us my american express card.  i 
read the fine print between doubl warranti polici of amex and citibank
visa.  sure, both will allow you doubl warranti on comput, but citibank
ha a maximum claim of $250.00.  could you imagin try to get your
monitor or mother board fix for $250.00?  amex ha no limit on claim.

rememb, if you us amex, you must either send a copi of the warranti info
to them in 30 dai from purchas, or you must call them to pre-regist and
then send them the paperwork within 90 dai of purchas (my pre-regist
pak arriv todai).  citibank visa requir no pre-registr.
