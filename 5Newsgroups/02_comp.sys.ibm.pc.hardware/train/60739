actual, it doe make a reason amount of sens. fix disk
sector ar buffer by the control, and transfer them to
memori with a 'rep insw' (or whatev the instruct is call) is
quit effici (singl instruct, goe as fast as the
control/cpu know how to us the bu). sinc the 286 wasn't cach,
the bu is like a critic resourc rel to cpu perform, and
it's possibl that dma bu interfer would caus as much or more
loss of cpu cycl (for 'comput') as doe the 'rep insw' sequenc.

the floppi, on the other hand, is not buffer, so that us the cpu
for floppi data transfer (as wa done on the pc jr, by the wai) realli
doe stink.
