***** window 3.1 enhanc mode:

     the window 3.1 instal program should automat configur do
and window for us with the adaptec 1542.  howev, just in case
someth went wrong, i'm go to describ some of the chang need
to get window 3.1 work with the 1542.  also, you mai have notic
that instal window 3.1 make your pc run much slower, even when
you're not run window; method of speed it up ar discuss in
the section call, "window 3.1 run slowli".


* msdo configur:

     the window instal program add the smartdriv disk cach to your
config.sy and autoexec.bat file.  if you follow the instruct,
you'll notic that you'll need to us doubl-buffer with smartdriv
(thi is the default setup).  you'll also notic that your system run
much, much slower -- in both window *and* msdo.  see the section
call, "window 3.1 run slowli", for some wai of speed your system
up.


* window configur:

     to get the adaptec 1542 to work with window, make sure that the
"[388enh]" section of the system.ini file contain the entri:

	virtualhdirq=off

i believ that the window instal program automat add thi entri
to system.ini, but i'm not sure.  if thi doesn't work for you, you
might want to try ad some more line:

	virtualhdirq=off
	systemrombreakpoint=fals
	emmexclud=a000-cfff

(you probabl don't need the abov line, though.)  the
"systemrombreakpoint" entri is us to enabl support for memori
manag like qemm/386max (onli need if you us such program).


* window 3.1 run slowli:

     onc you do get window 3.1 run with the 1542, chanc ar that
your system is run much slower than befor.  if it's not, it's
probabl becaus:

     1. you happen to be us aspi4do.sy version 3.1 in your
	config.sy file.  congratul -- thi appear to be a
	win solut.

     2. you ar veri lucki.  whether your luck will hold out remain to
	be seen ....

if your system is run much slower than befor, thi is almost
definit caus by smartdriv with doubl-buffer.  accord to the
window document, and the microsoft technic note #q81808
("smartdriv doubl buffer requir with aspi4do.sy"), you must us
smartdriv with doubl-buffer enabl.  while thi work, it realli
slow down your pc; i onc estim that thi slow my pc down by a
factor of 5 (five).  as i consid thi unaccept, i look for other
solut.

     unfortun, you cannot just disabl doubl-buffer.  if you
do, window 3.1 in enhanc mode will not work, and you might even
destroi the content of your hard disk by try to run window 3.1.
what you can do is on of the follow:

     1. us other driver that provid doubl-buffer.  it is my
	opinion that the unbeliev slow in smartdriv is caus
	either by horribl ineffici doubl-buffer, or by a bug in
	smartdriv.

     2. us a driver that provid "vd" servic ("vd" stand for
	"virtual dma servic").  thi is a standard, which is support
	by window 3.1, that allow bu-master disk control (like
	the 1542) to work with window.

     after trash my hard disk countless time, i found the follow
solut, none of which requir us smartdriv (note, howev, that i
am now get occasion pariti error, which ar probabl *not* caus
by these solut, but might be -- see below).  while the follow
doe not requir smartdriv, us some kind of disk cach util is
strongli recommend, as thi make window run much, much faster:

1. if you do not have the aspi4do.sy driver, or you do not need aspi
   function (for control a cdrom, tape drive, more than two
   physic hard disk, etc.), you can add the scsiha.sy driver to your
   config.sy file, e.g.:

	driver=c:\scsiha.sy /v386

   (window need the "/v386" option.)  thi driver must be load into
   low memori (it cannot be load into high memori), and it occupi
   about 16-20k.  as of novemb 1992, the scsiha.sy driver could be
   obtain from the adaptec bb at (408)-945-7727 (hopefulli, it's
   still there).

2. if you need aspi function and have the aspi4do.sy driver, version
   3.0 or 3.0a, you can us both the aspi4do.sy and scsiha.sy driver
   in your config.sy file, e.g.:

	driver=c:\aspi4do.sy
	driver=c:\scsiha.sy /v386

   amazingli enough, the scsiha.sy driver can also be load high
   (assum you have do 5.0); i would have thought that thi would
   crash my system, but it doesn't.  i ask adaptec's technic support
   about thi, and thei said that load scsiha.sy high should be fine
   as long as aspi4do.sy is load low.

   on my system, not us scsiha.sy with aspi4do 3.0a would
   occasion caus window 3.1 to crash upon restart or exit
   window, with the addit result of a corrupt disk (some of my
   c:\window\*.grp file would be corrupt).  for me, these crash
   usual occur while make a differ program from progman.ex
   the default window shell, and vice-versa.  thi is the reason
   scsiha.sy mai be necessari.

   i have absolut no idea if scsiha.sy is necessari with version of
   aspi4do earlier than 3.0.

   note that mani peopl can us aspi4do 3.0 or 3.0a without
   scsiha.sy; thei do not seem to have ani problem at all.  i consid
   these peopl lucki.  other, like me, have had all sort of problem.

3. in my opinion, the best, but not necessarili the easiest, solut is
   to upgrad to aspi4do 3.1.  the scsiha.sy driver is no longer
   need.  unfortun, while you could get previou aspi4do
   upgrad from the adaptec bb, the aspi4do 3.1 driver is not
   avail from the adaptec bb.  as far as i know, there ar onli
   three wai to get a copi:

      * you can bui the new (as of novemb 1992) adaptec ez scsi driver
	kit, which supposedli includ aspi4do 3.1 as well as other
	driver, such as cdrom driver.  i believ the list price is
	around $75.

      * if you alreadi have a copi of an older version of aspi4do, you
	can supposedli contact adaptec to upgrad it to ez scsi for
	around $30.

      * a copi of aspi4do 3.1 is includ in central point pc tool 8.0
	for msdo.  note that the document and driver ar store in
	differ directori.  note further that onli aspi4do is
	includ; the cdrom driver and driver to support more than two
	hard disk ar not includ.  thi is where i obtain my copi
	of aspi4do 3.1.

note, howev, that i am now get occasion pariti error with
window.  in all probabl, defect hardwar in my pc is caus
thi, as i upgrad my motherboard just after i found the abov
solut.  howev, becaus these pariti error occur onli dure disk
access, there is a veri small, but definit, possibl that the
pariti error ar driver-relat (for exampl, chang the bu on/off
time for certain disk transfer might caus thi).  i've run variou
memori test for hour at a time, and these test have found no
problem.  thi problem is probabl caus by memori with margin
time requir, which caus pariti error dure disk transfer
(thi is why the memori test didn't find ani problem -- the problem
show up onli under disk i/o).  howev, i'm mention thi just in case
it isn't a hardwar problem.


***** floppi-control-base tape backup devic:

     there ar two possibl problem with us the adaptec 1542 with a
floppi-control-base tape backup devic, such as the colorado memori
system jumbo 250:

1. tape backup/restor can take a veri long time.  the tape drive
   constantli start, stop, start, stop, etc.

2. tape oper mai be errat, or encount too mani tape error.
   (thi problem might be caus by defect hardwar on my 1542.
   howev, i've heard of other peopl have similar problem, and so
   i'm mention thi just in case it is not a hardwar problem on my
   1542.)


* tape backup/restor take a long time:

     if you have a floppi-control-base tape backup devic, you mai
have to adjust the adaptec 1540/1542 "bu on/off time" for best
result when us the tape drive.  normal, while do a tape backup
or restor, the tape drive motor should be continu run, with
onli an occasion paus.  howev, the default bu time on the
adaptec 1540/1542 mai caus the tape drive motor to start and stop,
start and stop, everi few second.  thi caus needless wear to the
tape and tape drive (howev, note that a dirti tape head or a defect
tape drive can also caus thi -- make sure your tape head ar clean).
thi also caus the tape backup or restor to take much, much longer
than necessari.

     the problem here is that these tape backup us the floppi dma to
transfer data in memori to/from the tape drive, and the adaptec us dma
to transfer data in memori to/from the hard disk.  the floppi dma need
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is
not fed data quickli enough by the floppi dma, the tape drive stop,
rewind a bit, and restart (onc enough data is eventu fed to it).
the default bu time on the adaptec (which is realli dma time) is
"too larg".  for exampl, when a backup is done, data ha to be
transfer from a hard disk to memori, and then from memori to the
tape.  becaus the default time on the adaptec "hog" the memori too
much (too much time is spent transfer data from a hard disk to
memori), not enough time is spent transfer data from memori to the
tape drive.  as a result, the tape drive constantli start and stop,
becaus data is not fed to it quickli enough.

     the solut is to chang the adaptec's bu on/off time.  the
default factori set is 11 microsecond on, and 5 microsecond off.
the "bu on" time need to be lower to 2-4 microsecond.  thi can
be done in on of two wai:

* if you have aspi4do, you can us the "/n" option.  for exampl, i us
  a "bu on" time of 4 microsecond, which mean that i us the
  follow line in my config.sy file:

	devic=c:\aspi4do.sy /n4

  note that there is no space between the "/n" and the "4".

* if you don't have aspi4do, your onli recours is to try to find a
  program call "setscsi.ex", which is veri difficult to find.  the
  reason is that adaptec, for reason of their own, doe not seem to
  want thi wide distribut.  i onc ask someon who work for
  adaptec, and thei ask me to not upload it anywher.  if you have
  anonym ftp access to the internet, you could try us archi to
  hunt down a copi; i believ that there ar a coupl of site that have
  it.  if you do find a copi, you run it like so:

	setscsi -n:4

  thi adjust the "bu on" time to 4 microsecond.  run
  setscsi.ex without ani argument reset the bu time back to the
  factori default.

  note that it seem that you cannot us setscsi.ex if you us
  aspi4do; setscsi.ex crash my system if aspi4do wa load.  i
  could us setscsi.ex with scsiha.sy, howev.

do not lower the "bu on" time below 2 microsecond, or increas it
abov 11 microsecond.  if you lower it too low, the hard disk
throughput will suddenli drop; your system will feel slower.  for me, 4
microsecond work fine.  thi valu mai work fine for you, or you mai
have to adjust it downward a littl.

     onc you've lower the "bu on" time, tape backup and restor
should run faster.

     also, do not experi with the bu on/off time (with the other
option that i have intention not describ), unless you know what
you ar do.  bad combin can caus pariti error and wors, by
starv memori refresh.

     a program call bustifix.ex exist on the adaptec bb.  unless
thi ha been upgrad sinc i last check (which ha been a while),
thi is a self-extract archiv contain a batch file and a coupl
of other file.  thi batch file wa suppos to allow on to set the
bu on/off time for the 1540/1542 and other.  howev, when i tri
run thi program with my 1542a, my system crash.  at the time, i
wa run scsiha.sy, and i didn't check to see if there wa a
conflict with it.  mayb thi old program work onli with the 1542b,
although the doc sai that it work with the 1542a?


* errat tape oper or too mani tape error:

     thi "problem" mai or mai not exist.  although it exist on my
system, a hardwar problem just on my particular 1542 could caus it.
howev, i've heard of other peopl have similar problem, and so i'm
mention thi just in case it isn't a hardwar problem just on my
1542.

     symptom of thi "problem", which persist even after clean the
tape head:

1. back up to tape encount "unus sector detect" error,
   result in an abort tape backup.

2. tape backup work, but the tape compar fail.

3. the tape drive start, stop, start, stop, etc. much too often.
   unlik the abov-mention problem ("tape backup/restor take a
   long time"), where the tape drive start and stop everi few second,
   thi kind of start/stop occur everi few 10-20 second or so.

4. fastback plu 3.1 doe not find/see ani tape backup devic.  other
   program, like central point backup and the cm jumbo softwar
   (assum that you have a cm jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the
   tape drive, but fastback plu 3.1 cannot.

5. too mani tape read error.

     although i do not know what is caus thi problem, i discov
that us a differ floppi control solv it.  a few month ago, i
upgrad my motherboard, which contain an integr floppi
control.  as i alreadi had a floppi control on the 1542, i
initi disabl the motherboard floppi control.  after a while, i
decid to try disabl the 1542 floppi control and us the on on
the motherboard.  when i did thi, the tape drive (a cm jumbo 250)
reliabl increas dramat, and fastback plu 3.1 wa suddenli
abl to find and us the tape drive.

     i don't know if thi wa caus by a hardwar problem on my 1542.
on the on hand, the floppi drive work great when thei were attach
to the 1542, which seem to sai that there wa noth wrong with the
1542.  on the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attach to
the 1542 floppi control, but it did work when attach to a differ
control; thi could be an indic of a hardwar problem on my
1542.  i did chang floppi drive cabl, and so it is conceiv that
the problem wa in the cabl.  i don't know what the caus realli is;
howev, if you're have similar problem, you might want to consid
try a new floppi control.


***** sound card:

     mani popular sound card can plai or record digit sound, and
thi is typic done us dma.  like the tape drive dma, the
adaptec's dma can conflict with the sound card dma.  unlik that of the
tape dma, thi "conflict" usual manifest itself as a pariti error
(your system crash with a pariti error messag).  what happen is
that, data is be transfer so quickli by the sound card and the
adaptec, memori refresh cannot occur quickli enough, which caus a
pariti error.  usual, get a pariti error mean that there is a
hardwar problem with your system; in thi case, howev, the pariti
error is not a symptom of bad hardwar.

     i've found that such pariti error typic occur while record
digit sound, and the chanc of such error increas as you increas
the record fidel (e.g., higher sampl rate, record in stereo,
record us 16-bit instead of 8, etc.).

     like the tape drive solut, the solut here is to lower the
adaptec's "bu on" time.  see the section on tape drive for
inform on how thi is done.  note, howev, that thi mai or mai
not solv the problem; it mai onli reduc the probabl of a pariti
error.  the softwar us to record digit sound can greatli affect
thi problem (i.e., some softwar is ineffici).  disk cach, the
speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragment can also
affect thi.


***** miscellan info:

     thi section contain miscellan hint, tip, and rumor.  much
of it is mere inform that i've heard or read about, and have not
verifi.  i believ that the follow inform is correct, but i'm
not sure.  us it at your own risk.

* with qemm 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specifi the "db="
  paramet (e.g., "db=2"), unless you ar us the aspi4do driver.
  if you don't, qemm will crash/hang at bootup.  although the qemm
  manual mention thi, the instal program doe not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automat add thi option to the qemm
  command line (at least, thi occur with the qemm 6.00 instal
  program -- i haven't test ani other version).  earlier version of
  qemm probabl need thi paramet, but i'm not sure (i've never us a
  version earlier than 6.00).

  if you us aspi4do, you do not need to give qemm the "db=" paramet.

* some or all version of the 1542 do not support hard disk over on
  gigabyt in size.  to support hard disk with capac over 1gb, you
  need to get a new rom bio from adaptec.  i'm not sure if thi is
  still true of the latest 1542bs be sold by adaptec.

* to connect a cdrom drive to the 1542, you need a scsi cdrom drive and
  some driver.  note that some cdrom drive have proprietari interfac
  (non-scsi); these drive cannot be us with the 1542.  you have three
  choic for cdrom driver (i have no idea how well the follow
  solut work, or even if thei work -- the follow is secondhand
  inform):

     1. you can bui adaptec's ez scsi driver packag, which list for
	someth like $75.  if you alreadi have older adaptec driver,
	you can supposedli upgrad to ez scsi for around $30.  contact
	adaptec for detail.  the ez scsi packag supposedli contain
	everyth that you need.

     2. you can bui the corelscsi! driver packag, which is made by the
	same peopl that make coreldraw!  thi packag contain cdrom
	driver, scsi tape driver, worm driver, etc.  i do not know
	the list price, but i've seen thi packag sold for around
	$80-$90.  note that corelscsi! doe not come with the aspi4do
	driver, which is need.  if you do not alreadi have aspi4do,
	you mai be better off get adaptec's ez scsi instead.

     3. [thi method is obsolet, as the follow driver have been
	obsolet by adaptec's ez scsi kit, but i'm mention it in
	case someon alreadi ha these driver.]  you can us the
	driver in the adaptec asw-1410 kit (aspi4do) and the asw-410
	kit (aspi cdrom driver).  you will have to get a copi of
	mscdex.ex (a high-level cdrom driver), if it is not includ in
	the asw-410 kit, but thi is avail from sever bulletin
	board.

* to us a scsi tape drive with the 1542, you need softwar that know
  how to talk to a scsi tape drive.  softwar that i've heard about ar
  (again, like the abov section on cdrom drive, i have no idea how
  well the follow solut work, or even if thei work -- the
  follow is secondhand inform):

     1. central point pc tool 8.0 for msdo supposedli support a larg
	number of scsi tape drive.  it come with scsi driver
	(aspi4do 3.1) as well as central point backup.

     2. the corelscsi! driver packag contain a scsi tape backup
	program (see the abov section on cdrom drive for more
	detail).  howev, note that corelscsi! doe not come with, but
	requir, aspi4do.

* i've seen advertis that sell the 1542 in three configur:

     1. 1542 scsi control with hard disk rom bio.
     2. 1542 scsi control w/bio and adaptec aspi driver.
     3. 1542 scsi control w/bio, adaptec aspi driver, and
	corelscsi! driver/program.

  i imagin that adaptec now sell the 1542 in a fourth configur:

     4. 1542 scsi control w/bio and ez scsi driver (includ aspi
	driver).

* those peopl who us unix might be interest in a version of gnu tar
  for msdo that talk to a scsi tape drive via the aspi4do driver (you
  need thi driver befor you can us thi program).  i've never us
  thi version of gnu tar, but i've heard that it work (i don't know
  how well, though).  if you have anonym ftp access to the internet,
  a copi can be found on wsmr-simtel20.armi.mil and mirror site:

	pd1:<msdo.dskutl>
	aspibin.zip  67841 920131 gnu tar for scsi tape drive, adaptec 154xx
	aspipat.zip  21206 920131 patch for aspibin rel to gnu tar 1.10
	aspisrc.zip 221370 920131 src for gnu tar for scsi tape, adaptec ctrlr

  i have no idea if a copi can be found on compuserv; unixforum might
  have it, if ani forum doe.

* as far as msdo is concern, the 1542a and the 1542b control ar
  the same; with msdo, the 1542a should work as well as the 1542b.
  howev, the hardwar for these two board is not 100% ident, and
  there is at least on (non-msdo) program that initi did not work
  with a 1542a, but did work with a 1542b (bsd386 -- a 386 version of
  bsd unix).

  note that i'm us qemm and aspi4do 3.1.  if i were us aspi4do
  3.0 or 3.0a, i'd probabl have to us a config.sy that look like:

	file=40
	buffer=40
	break=on
	stack=10,256
	devic=c:\sy\dev\aspi4do.sy /d /n4
	devic=c:\qemm\qemm386.sy on ram rom dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff
	do=high,umb
	devicehigh=c:\sy\dev\scsiha.sy /v386
	devicehigh=c:\sy\dev\nnansi.sy
	devicehigh=c:\do\setver.ex
	shell = c:\do\command.com /p

  if i weren't us aspi4do, i'd probabl us someth that look
  like:

	file=40
	buffer=40
	break=on
	stack=10,256
	devic=c:\sy\dev\scsiha.sy /v386
	devic=c:\qemm\qemm386.sy on ram rom db=32 dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff
	do=high,umb
	devicehigh=c:\sy\dev\nnansi.sy
	devicehigh=c:\do\setver.ex
	shell = c:\do\command.com /p

  howev, if i us a floppi-control-base tape drive, or if i
  plan to record high-qualiti sound from a sound card, i would still
  need some wai of chang the adaptec's bu on/off time.  the first
  two version of config.sy take care of thi, but thi last version
  doesn't.
