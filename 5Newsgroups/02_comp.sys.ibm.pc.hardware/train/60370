	i have on and it is my favorit cd-rom drive so far.  i also have 
a nec-74 and have had experi with sever other drive (variou 
phillip drive)

	the 3401 is faster than the nec, i like it door better (the nec 
need 2 hand), the xa handl (the nec need to be re-boot to go from 
xa to rom while the 3401 doe it on the fly), all in all i am serious 
consid replac my nec with anoth toshiba.
