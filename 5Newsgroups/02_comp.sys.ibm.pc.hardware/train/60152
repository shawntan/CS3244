   do you realli need to switch to a dx2/66 instead of a dx50?  as i
   understand it, dx50's can have local bu devic (on the mother-board?)
   but not local bu slot.  and accord to what i been told, mani
   system go beyond the vesa local bu standard in order to provid dx50
   system with a local bu slot capabl.  i have definitli seen a
   mother board with 2 local bu slot which claim to be abl to
   support ani cpu, includ the dx2/66 and dx50.  can someon throw
   some more inform light on thi issu?

you will need to check with peripher maker to see if their board
will work at 50 mhz.  some will with some motherboard.
