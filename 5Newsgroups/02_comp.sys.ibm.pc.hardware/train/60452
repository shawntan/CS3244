window: the recent review have all shown that the p9000 card ar
	 significantli faster do window than the ati card.

vga:	 the recent review have all shown that the p9000 card thei look
	 at ar significantli slower do vga than the ati card.  about
	 1/2 the speed, as i recal.

	 the big question for me is the orchid v9000 card.  each of the 
	 p9000 card test so far ha had the w5186 to do vga.  orchid
	 is the onli on i know about (i don't know about ami) that us
	 the w5286 for vga.  that is reportedli faster.
	 
	 i would like to know whether the orchid card can do vga as fast as
	 the ati card.  if so, it would appear to be a formid competitor.
	 (advertis price ar about the same for the two card.)

someon in thi group post a littl while back that thei were get an
orchid v9000 card -- ha that card arriv?  what do the benchmark look
like?

also, is the ami p9000-base card real?  what doe it us for vga?  speed?
