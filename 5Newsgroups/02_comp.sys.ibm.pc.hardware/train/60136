i just tri a few experi. i cat'd a 20261-byte file (471 line)
under variou scenario:

pc-xview for do in a full-screen os/2 window (1024x768x16):    18 sec
telix (do) in an os/2 window (1024xs768x256):                  107 sec!
telix (do) is a full-screen os/2 window (standard vga):        11 sec
telix (do) in a window 3.1 window (1024x768x256):             30 sec
uw/win in a seamless os/2 window (1024x768x256):        gave up after 4 min!
uw/win in window 3.1 (1024x768x256):           faster, but gave up after 2 min
uw/win in a seamless os/2 window us pg       30 sec, could have been a
                                                littl faster (i had to keep
                                                hit the space bar)

i wa us an ati wonder xl video card, by the wai.

so pc-xview for do look pretti good (and the line-by-line scroll
in os/2 desktop look pathet, although full-page redraw ar pretti
good).

i tri it under pc-xview us my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font,
and with a veri small font, and there wa no differ in the time.
the modem receiv light wa on pretti solidli, so it look like the
bottleneck wa the 9600-baud modem, not the screen draw.
