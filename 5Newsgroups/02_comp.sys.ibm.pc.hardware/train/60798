i don't know the exact mean of uart, but i think it is someth like
univers arithmet receiv transmitt. normal, the older board have
a 8250 or 16450 uart on board. those chip gener an irq for everi char
thei receiv. the 16550 uart ha an intern 16 byte buffer, so - with the
right softwar instal - it gener an irq everi 16 char.

if you ran do, you don't need a 16550, becaus do run onli on task at a
time and the whole cpu-power could be us for the transfer. but if you ar
run a multitask os such as os/2, unix, etc. ( window ? :-) ), the
cpu cannot work the whole time with on task. 

the result ar lost charact or broken transmiss becaus of timeout.

> 4) is it onli for intern modem?

no. the onli diffrenc is that intern modem have the uart on board,
wherea extern modem ar connect to the comput over a serial port
which ha the uart on board.

i us a zyxel1496b with a 16550uart under coher 4.0. i'm veri satisfi
with it but i think that nearli everyon is satisfi with hi own modem.
