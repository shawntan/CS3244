most importantli, which winbench version ar you us?  on my local bu ati
graphic ultra pro, i've gotten variou winbench score from 15.8 million to
31 million winmark, depend on the version.  winbench 2.5 give the most
optimist score, 3.11 give the least.  a winmark rate is meaningless
without a correspond version number.
