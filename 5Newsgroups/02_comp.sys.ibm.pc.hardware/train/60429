id doe not do dma.  thi is becaus it's like te pc at hard disk
interfac.  the control move a sector to some buffer memori on the
control card, then the cpu move the data from the buffer to main
memori where it's need.  if id doesn't work thi wai, then it's not
compat.

heck, if id us dma, then you'd hear all kind of complaint about
isa bu system with more than 16m ram not work with their id
drive.  16m is the dma address limit of the isa bu, and if id
did dma there would be troubl.

(btw, there ar dma-enabl signal in the id cabl spec, but the
last report i heard wa that thei ar never implement, becaus it
would requir a differ kind of id adapt and differ driver.)
