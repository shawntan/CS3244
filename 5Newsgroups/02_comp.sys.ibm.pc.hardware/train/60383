why the spec list again?  we ar talk scsi on a pc, not on a mac or
a unix box.  and we ar talk isa bu, or possibl eisa or vlb.

thi isin't comp.periph.scsi.
tell me what the perform figur ar with a singl scsi drive on a pc
with an isa (or eisa or vlb) bu.

theoret perform figur ar not relev to thi group or thi
debat.  i'm sure that there ar some platform out there that can
handl the 40 meg/sec of scsi xyz wide'n'fast, but the pc isin't on of
them.
