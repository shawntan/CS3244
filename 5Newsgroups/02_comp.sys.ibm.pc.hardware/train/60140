someth to bear in mind is what the v in vlb stand for!

v for video - the origion intent of the bu wa to speed up
the bu so that larg memori to memori transfer would be faster.
thi is espic us in transfer data from main memori to
video memori.

sinc there ar usual 3 vlb slot card maker have been make 
card to fit in the other two. 

how about an vlb ethernet card? move the data into the card at
130 odd mb/s and then wait for it to tickl onto the net at
just over 1mb/s.

[ do do howev free the local bu for other card ]

some time you need fast buss and sometim you don't!
