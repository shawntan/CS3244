        i'm bui a new system thi week to replac my brain dead 286, and
could us some feedback on a coupl system i'm look at if anyon is
familiar with them.
 
        the system that look the most interest is the budget 486/66 vlb
tower.  for about $2343 (deliv) it offer vlb, 8mb, 200mb id, a mitsumi
cd-rom (with softwar bundl), media vision sound board, 14" ctx 1468ni,
128k cach, and the usual drive, port, & os softwar.  sinc my budget is
$2350 for a system, it seem almost too good to be true (which mai mean it
is too good to be true, of cours). among other thing, i've never seen a
review of the budget system (or their parent compani, micro smart), or of
the motherboard thei ar us (the aetana). ani feedback would be
appreci.
 
        in a similar vein, the second system i'm consid midwest micro's
elit vesa 486/66 tower with a diamond viper (2mb) & midwest micro 14" mi
monitor is on i've never seen review anywher.  i'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line - and some idea of their qualiti would be abig
benefit here as well.
 
        ani other suggest in the price rang would be appreci - my
greatest need ar speed and graphic capabl.
 
	email respons would be greatli appreci.

	thank,
