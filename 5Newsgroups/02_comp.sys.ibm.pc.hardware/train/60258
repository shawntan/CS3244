i have a logitech 2s-2f (or 2f-2s) 2-button mous that i want to
interfac to a serial port of a differ (non-ibm-compat) system.
the mous is xt/at/ps2 compat, with a db25 connector.  i tri
to revers engin the mous, but it ha a micro-control insid
it.

if i could get the db25 pin-out, and perhap a copi of the bio routin
that support it, i could map all thi into my target system?
