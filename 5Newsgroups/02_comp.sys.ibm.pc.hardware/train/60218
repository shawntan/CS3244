oh yeah! i just got my new eizo flexscan yesterdai (to replac my old 8515), and
i tri it with 1360x1024. thi mode is just great! i can get four perfectli readabl
command window on the screen! and if i need more color, i can go back to 1024x768
or even 800x600.
on thing i am wonder though: why isn't there a monxxxx.dg file which contain
all the resolut up to 1360x1024? now i have to chang the xgasetup.pro everi
time i want to switch, instead of simpli go through the system set of os/2.
regard, martin erzberg
