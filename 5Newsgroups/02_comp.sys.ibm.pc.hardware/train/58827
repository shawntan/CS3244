you realiz, of cours, that inevit some anal retent moron is
go to come along and wag hi finger and hi jowl in outrag that
person polit ar more import than [smcap][bold][font:god
999pt.]the law[smcap][bold][font].

but that's irrelev to the problem here.  window came with my
system, but on 5.25" disk.  i hate us 5.25" disk, so i copi
them over to high densiti 3.5"'s us xcopi.  it work fine.  in
fact, for a while i wa chang configur and whatnot so much
that i decid to try put them on the hard disk.  not onli can you
copi them over with on disk per directori, but if you want to, you
can simpli copi them all into on directori.  make it a lot nicer
when you're switch printer emul around.

norton 6.0 i don't have much experi with, but when a friend's
system crash, we restor from a backup rather than from the
origin, and it work fine.  thi would impli that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would creat a workabl backup, and if you did a full instal
the first time, you've got the whole thing.

never plai with wp for window; i'm not too big of a fan of anyth
from utah.

good luck....

disclaim: don't copi that floppi! (tm) just sai no! (r) respect your elder!
for the wage of sin is (sic) death and a hefti legal bill!  do you offend?
