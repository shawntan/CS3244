hi all,

  i would like to purchas cd-rom drive. the spec i would like to have is:

   * applic to kodak multisess photo-cd
   * scsi(2) interfac
   * compat with adaptec-1542b
   * doe not need ani caddi
   * cheaper ( < $500 if possibl)
   * doubl speed

  i believ there ar no drive satisfi all of the abov condit,
  so i would like to know all of your opinion.  the abov condit
  ar sort by my prioriti.
  i think nec cdr74-1/84-1 is a littl bit expens, but it doe satisfi
  almost all of the abov condit. the problem is that i do not know
  the compat with 1542b. ha someon succeed to connect these
  nec drive to 1542b? i have heard a rumor that nec drive is incompat
  with 1542b adapt.
  ani suggest ar greatli appreci.

thank in advanc,
kobayashi,masaoki
