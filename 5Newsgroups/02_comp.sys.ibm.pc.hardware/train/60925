ha anyon connect a high-re, fix frequenc monitor to their pc?
i have a mitubishi monitor that doe 1024x768 at 60hz, but won't do
ani other resolut.  all the video card design for thi sort of
thing ar veri expens (>$400).  ha anyon done it with an svga
card (i know it can be done, it's just a question of get the card
at the right resolut and frequenc)?  i'd like to us a mono
(hercul) monitor as my do/command line monitor, and switch to the
mitsu for window or x-window (under linux or 3bsd).

ani suggest would be greatli appreci.  e-mail, pleas.

thank,
