hei folk.

is it possibl to short out your cmo chip?  i think mine is fri.
these ar the symptom...

i have to do the follow to get my comput (a gatewai 486dx33)
to boot...

    turn the power off

    disconnect the batteri to the cmo chip

    turn the power on

    get into setup upon get the cmo configur error

    set up the cmo

    exit the setup with [f10]  (phoenix bio)

    ignor the diskett 0 seek error and press [f1]

the comput then boot normal.  both hard drive ar access
but the floppi drive ar not.

i can back up over the network and such, but if i need to reboot,
i have to turn off the comput and repeat the step abov.  if i
simpli <ctl>-<alt>-<del>, the comput hang after the memori test.
