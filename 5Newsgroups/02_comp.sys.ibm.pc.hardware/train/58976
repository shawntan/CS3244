hi netter!
	i often have troubl with my pc and would like to fix it by myself.  is 
	there ani book that show you how to fix your own pc (hardwar, monitor,
	printer problem..etc).  of cours, no book would tell you the exact
	problem with your pc, but at least it will give a gener idea what
	might be wrong.  thank so lot for your help.
