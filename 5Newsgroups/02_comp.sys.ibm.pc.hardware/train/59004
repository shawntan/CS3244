first of all, thank to those of you who respond, both here and via e-mail.
the tip didn't pan out, but it wa good hear from you.

now, follow up to my earlier post:
[...]
: disk control:  acculog side-3 2 hard/2 floppi id control
:   jumper:  all default (shown as *):  
:     normal irq*/delai irq     primari*/secondari floppi address
:     singl*/dual speed floppi   primari*/secondari id address
:     precomp = 125ns*/187 ns     iochrdi not driven*/id drive control iochrdi
[...]
: other card:  (didn't check brand) 2 serial/1 parallel adapt
: 	      logitech bu mous adapt
: 	      roland mpu-401-compat midi interfac 
: 		configur with default irq 2, mem address 0330

i open up the box and remov all the "other card" abov.  no help there.
then, not have anyth better to try, i chang normal irq to delai
irq on the disk control (didn't make ani differ) and iochrdi_not_
driven to id_drive_control_iochrdi (also had no effect).  so i put 
everyth back to the wai it wa and re-instal the card.

i then unplug the floppi drive cabl from the disk control.  voila!,
the pc boot from power up, although it seem to take sever second 
befor the first access to the hard disk.  plug the floppi cabl back
to the control and the origin (non-boot) behavior return.

o.k., with thi addit inform, doe anyon in netland have ani 
word of wisdom for what's go on and how i should deal with it?
