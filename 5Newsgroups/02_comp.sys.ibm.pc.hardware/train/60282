    the joystick read in anolog valu through a digit port. how?
    you send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
    it take for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  thi time
    is proport to the joystick posit.  obvious, sinc time
    is us as a posit, you cannot get rid of thi ridiculu wast 
    of time.  if you wrote your own routin instead of the bio, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.
