i have a 286 with an m205 motherboard.  the last byte memori manag (which
i download for a trial) report the chipset is an addtech pcchip1 chipset,
and it is abl to activ the ram behind segment a000-ffff, which can then be
us for umb (except for video/bio).  i would like to write my own driver to
activ the memori.  doe anyon know where i can get program inform
on thi chip?
