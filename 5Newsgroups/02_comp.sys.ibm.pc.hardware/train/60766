i think it all depend on your motherboard and the card you have in your system.  your hd stop boot probabl becaus your hd control can't handl the faster bu speed.  i have a 486-33dx, i set my bu divid to clk/2.5, that is close to 13mhz.  i can gain singific performac increas on my video card and harddisk transfer rate when i boost the bu speed.  and my system work flawlessli under thi set.  and you know what, when i go to clk/2(17mhz bu), my hd refus to boot.  

just my 2 cent.
