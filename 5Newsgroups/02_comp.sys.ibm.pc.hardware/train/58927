thi mai be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a
wai to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)
to get the usual 8?  my case ha slot for 8, and i'd like to
get a scanner, but with all my other card i'm alreadi max'd out!
i'm hope that a simpl solut exist, e.g. an adapt that turn
on slot into three.  i don't mind if it turn it into 8-bit slot,
as i can put my i/o card, midi card, and soundblast card there.
my other card ar 16 bit (id/floppi, svga, modem).

if there is such an expand, doe that screw up perform of
everyth els?  i'd hate to bui a new motherboard! :-(
