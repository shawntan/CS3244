     no, you need not bypass the config.sy, in do 6.0, there is a function 
of multi-config, have you tri boot.sy ? the multi-config is the kind that 
you can choos you config.sy at the startup. and i find that is veri good. 
it ha no conflict to qemm. (i have problem when us boot.sy)
    the kei you sai is f8, which is trace the config.sy step by step.
    sorri, if ani error :)
