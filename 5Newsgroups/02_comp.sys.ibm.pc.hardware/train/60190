i'm us int15h to read my joystick, and it is hideous slow.  someth
like 90% of my cpu time is be spent read the joystick, and thi
is in a program that doe noth but printf() and joyread().

the problem is that a lot of program trap int15h ( like smartdrv ) and
so it is a slow as hell interfac.  can i read the joystick port in
a reason safe fashion via poll?  and that isn't platform or
clockspe specif?

thank,
