sinc the quadra is the onli mac abl to deal with 5mb/s and hard drive start
at 160mb i have no idea.
for the mac i have the follow {these ar all extern}
 20mb $299 {$15/mb}
 52mb $379 {$7.3/mb}
 80mb $449 {$5.63/mb}
120mb $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/mb
210mb $979-$1029{$4.67-$4.90/mb}
320mb $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/mb}
510mb $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/mb}
etc

so scsi-1/scsi-2 for the mac goe down in price/mb as hard drive size goe
up {and i assum the same for the pc world.}

well scsi is also a floppi drive interfac.  in the mac {sinc scsi is the
intefac for ani non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard devic} the id 7 is us
for the floppi drive {call cpu in all identifi.}  thi allow cross
drive interfac as fast as the os, program, cpu, scsi, and drive can handl 
it{thi show up best in the quatra line}.
in the ibm that us scsi for the floppi drive thi should happen as well.
also scsi is not just drive but printer, scanner, expands card 
{thi show up for the plu as the nubu 'cage'}, cd-rom, etc.
id seem to be mainli hard drive.  as for spec nobodi ha given me ani
and i can't find ani.  besid the advertiz call id the at interfac
{make of that what you will}
scsi is a jack of all trade and id is a master of on.
thi alon put scsi abov id.  scsi-2 blow id out of the water.
rememb scsi wa us in high price machin until about 18 month ago
{when the mac price came down to earth} so the rule of scale still plai
and scsi remain high cost{cheap seem to mean chezzi in the high end
comput world at time and thi more than anyth els proabli kept scsi
off into the statospher price wise}
scsi came from the high end comput world with multitask os were the
standard for the most part.  of all the interfac next could have us it
choos scsi.  in 16-bit and 32-bit mode scsi is a multi-task os desin
interfac while id and 8-bit scsi ar braindead run on program interfac
{at least the wai mac us 8-bit scsi.ugh}
