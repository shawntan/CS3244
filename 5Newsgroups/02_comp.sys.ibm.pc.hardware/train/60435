[stuff about the connect between id and ida deleat]
>8mhz clock, 16 bit width, 5mb/sec.
if id speed come from ida where doe the 8.3mb/s sight for id come from?

scsi is not complex. it is just the wai the industri us and talk about it.
there ar three kei differ in scsi; the control chip, the port, and
the softwar.  that is it.
let us look as scsi in from thi stand point.

scsi-1: asynchron and synchron mode {softwar scsi driver onli}
 asynchron is slower then synchron mode {onli 0-3mb/s vs. 0-5mb/s}
 synchron speed can be reach by most scsi-1 divic with a
 rewrit of the softwar driver {as is the case for the mac quadra.}

scsi-2 {8-bit}: thi is the main sourc for the confus. thi differ from
 scsi-1 onli in the control chip in most machin.  in the mac and some pc
 thi is call 'fast scsi-1' becaus it us scsi-1 port and softwar driver
 and can produc scsi-2 speed through scsi-1 inspit of thi even in the 
 slower asynchron mode.  averag speed in asynchron scsi-1 mode 
 4-6mb/s with 8mb/s{see in both quadra and higher end pc} synchron
 mode just allow a higher burst rate {10/mb/s}

scsi-2 {16-bit}: two version-wide/fast.  wide scsi-2 requir two thing
 over 8-bit scsi-2:  a scsi-2 softwar driver and a wide scsi port on the
 machin and the extern devic.
 fast scsi-2 also requir two thing over 8-bit scsi-2: scsi-2 driver
 softwar and that the reciev devis support 16-bit fast scsi-2.
 speed of both is the same: 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst.

scsi-2 {32-bit}:  also know as wide and fast scsi.  over 8-bit scsi-2 thi
 requir: scsi-2 driver softwar, wide scsi-2 port, and that the reciev
 devic also have a 32-bit mode scsi-2 chip.  as expect thi is veri
 expenc.  speed: 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst
 

as i said simpl.  seven version of scsi seper by softwar, the 
control chip, and the port. standar the softwar and it drop to
onli five version of scsi seper by onli hardwar {the chip and the port}
