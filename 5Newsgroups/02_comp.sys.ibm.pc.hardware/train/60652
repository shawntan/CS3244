in addit to startup time, i leav thing run becaus my pc doubl as 
a fax machin. 

howev, thi is off the origin subject. i didn't get the repli on bio, 
cmo, and do clock/date logic. all i know is that i've been run thi wai 
for mani month and it is onli recent, the last month, that i have notic 
the intermitt clock problem. as i state, it is not alwai the date that 
doesn't roll forward, sometim i notic that the clock is sever minut 
behind where it ought to be. 

when unattend, the follow ar gener run minim in win 3.1:

clock, winfax pro 3.0, print manag, ms-word 1.1, file manag, program 
manag

a random screen saver is gener run too.
