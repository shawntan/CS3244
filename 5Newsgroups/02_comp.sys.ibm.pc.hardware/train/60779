	hi everyon,
	i have a question regard my stack on my pc.  i am program 
in turbo c 3.0 and my program is rather larg (model larg too).  i keep 
get error that i am run out of memori after a while of run the 
program. when i compil the program, it sai i have 4.45 meg of ram so 
i can't seem to explain why it crash.

all it is do is run in a loop while the oper is idl and
after a while of sit, it will screw up all the variabl. thi lead
me to believ that my stack is fill up and overflow.  

doe the program take memori up when it is call void function
that do not return anyth??

	i have been work on thi problem for dai and i would realli
appreci ani responc.  if thi is not the correct newsgroup, i will
gladli re-post, but thi is the onli i could find.

thank in advanc,
sean mar
