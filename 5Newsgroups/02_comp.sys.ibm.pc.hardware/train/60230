i start a similar thread about a month ago, and got mani repli.
the summari:

ctx 14": nasti, low qualiti. avoid.

ctx 15" proscan: not as good as some other make; howev, cheap.
  main problem seem poor qualiti control. some report pincushion
  (the problem i had), other poor focu, etc, etc.

i complain about mine and it wa 're-tune' (i dodn't even pai
ship) and return to me in 2 dai. 

it's now clear, well-focuss and ha no pincushion or barrel
distort at all. i'm veri happi with it, and the digit
control and mode memori ar nice. certainli, a trinitron
(sai) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price rang.

conclus: if you're on a budget, get on and be prepar to
send it back if it's not perfect. it probabl won't be when you get it,
but ha good potenti.
