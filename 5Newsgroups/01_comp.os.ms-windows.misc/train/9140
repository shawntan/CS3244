on ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/misc/winadv.zip is a writeup by
steve gibson of infoworld with winbench 3.11 and a number of other 
benchmark result for nine isa and four vlb video card.  thi is a 
veri current upload and is like to have ani card you're current 
give seriou consider.  not in xl format.  latest version of
winbench that i know of is ver 3.11.  i believ thei try to maintain
the same rate scale between version, and new version ar releas
to defeat the lastest code trick put in by driver programm to
beat the benchmark.  don't know on the last on.
