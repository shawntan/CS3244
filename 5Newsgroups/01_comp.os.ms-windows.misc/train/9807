you could us do 6 to do thi partli.  you can set up differ config.sy
and autoexec.bat command for each user, and thei just have to select their
menu option on bootup.  then you can have the autoexec.bat copi the win.ini
and system.ini file and chang directori for them.  when thei exit window,
it can copi back gener .ini file if you want.

thi is the onli wai i can think of.  there mai be some program somewher
that allow you to do thi better, though us do 6 allow each person to
have a custom config.sy and autoexec.bat.
