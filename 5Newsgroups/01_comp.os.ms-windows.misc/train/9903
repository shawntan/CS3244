hei all...i got an equat editor, and sinc it didn't automag
appear in my "object" dialog box (i.e. insert-->object-->equat), i
decid to manual place it there.  so i went into win.ini (is there
anoth wai to do thi?), the [embed] section, and ad 

equat=equat,equat,<path\filenam>,pictur.

didn't work.
quit window, go back.  aha: mistak. correct it.  it look fine.
start window...doesn't work.  plai with it for a while, at on point
have two entri to see if on work and th'other don't, and final i
get it to work.  the onli thing i can see that's differ now is that
it's now the first item on the list, and it us to be the last.  but
now i end up with *three* "equat" entri, and *all* of them work.
(and onli on entri in win.ini).

so doe ani netian know what's wrong? or rather, how to correct thi?
(i.e. make "equat"appear but onc?).

also, all the entri in the [embed] appear as abov.
it's obviou that <path\filenam> is the execut, or whatev, and
"pictur" ha someth to do withth wai it appear
(pictur/descript?)

but what ar the other?
i.e., in

soundrec=sound,sound,
whate's the differ between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd?  
and what is "soundrec"?? (i don't think it's the name of the execut,
as other entri (e.g. msworkschart=...) aren't)

thank, i.a.
mickei
