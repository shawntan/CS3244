i have (had) sever problem with the card.
- applic crash when move the mous (vga mode). fix by remov
  the line stack=0,0 from config.sy. the default valu stack=9,256
  doe just fine.
- random white pixel all over the screen when move the mous, in a
  256 color graphic mode (the hardwar cursor mode). fix by turn
  off the hardwar scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") befor enter the graphic
  mode. thi also fix the problem of the window do box under window.
  with the hardwar scroll enabl, applic write garbag outsid the
  window.
- the screensav do not remov the cursor in 256 color mode (hardwar
  cursor). i don't know if thi is a window problem or a driver problem.
  clearli there should be two type of cursor remov function: a remov-
  for-draw, which can be ignor for hardwar cursor and a remov-
  uncondition. do other card with hardwar cursor have the same problem?
- the vesa driver doe not support the 640x480x16m truecolor mode. (univers
  vesa driver do not run at all).
