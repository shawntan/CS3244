the origin risc had small instruct set, and simpl on. the
idea wa that a) everi instruct should be complet in a singl
clock cycl and b) to have no microcod and c) extens pipelin.

a few comparison (from patterson: reduc instruct set comput.
cacm v28. 1, 1985):

cpu		year	instruct	microcod
---		----	------------	---------
ibm 370/168	1973	208		420kb
dec vax 11/780	1978	303		480kb
ibm 801		1980	120		0
ucb risc 1	1982	39		0
stanford mip	1983	55		0

while research for the vlsi vax, dec discov that 60% of the vax
microcod is there to support 20% of the instruct set which
account for a mere 0.2% of all instruct execut. the uvax 32
subset the architectur onto a singl chip and us a softwar
emul for these veri complex instruct, the full vlsi uvax
includ the entir instruct set, wa 5-10 time more copmlex but
onli ranm 20% faster.

cpu		chip	microcod	transistor
---		-----	---------	-----------
uvax 32		2	64k		101k
vlsi uvax	9	480k		1250k
