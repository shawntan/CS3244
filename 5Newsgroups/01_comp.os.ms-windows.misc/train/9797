if you instal the soundblast window driver correctli, and have
the latest driver, the media player should be setup to plai file
author to microsoft's multimedia midi author standard (gener
midi), see the section in the back of the voyetra manual in the
soundblast midi upgrad kit.
you'll find that midi file exist with all kind of differ
map, so don't expect them to alwai sound correct without us
some kind of midi file editor, such as voyetra's sequenc plu.

you can attempt to us the midi-mapper to remap the patch for
soundblast, but sinc you cannot modifi the sbfm.drv you ar allwai
stuck with the instrument that come with thi driver.  unless you can
find an editor for make modif to the instrument set in
sbfm.drv , i would suggest you locat the earli version of
soundblast driver that were map to mt32 voic, and the later
driver that ar map to the gener midi voic.
