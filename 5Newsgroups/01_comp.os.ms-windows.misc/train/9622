i hope thi will clear it up :

(taken from on of my lectur note)

 " ...  the altern approach (to cisc),
 which ha been adopt by mani in
 recent year, ha come to be known as "risc": the reduc
 instruct set comput.  thi can be characteris simpli as
 "simpler is faster"; by simplifi the design (e.g.  by reduc
 the varieti of instruct & address mode), the hardwar can be
 design to run faster.  even at the cost of need more
 instruct, the same task can be done more quickli by the simpler,
 faster design.

 a typic risc processor will:

    o provid a larg number of regist (e.g.  32);

    o perform all data oper on regist;

    o provid few address mode (e.g. immedi or 'regist + offset');

    o onli allow load & store oper to access memori;

    o onli us a few instruct format;

    o onli support a few data type (e.g. integ, unsign, float).
