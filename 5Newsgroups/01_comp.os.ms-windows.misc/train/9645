ha anyon els been plai with that wincmd util from pc magazin?
if so, i am have troubl concaten string variabl togeth and
need your help.  for exampl:
temp = "path"
temp2 = "file.ext"
fullpath = temp+"/"
sai fullpath			// output = 'th/'
fullpath = fullpath+temp2
sai fullpath			// output = 'h/file.ext'

so, it seem to be drop the first few charact with each
concaten.  is it that i am out of memori -- i onli have mayb 20
variabl total -- the articl didn't mention memori limit. 

email me if you have an idea or would like to see the actual sourc and
output.  thank for your help.
