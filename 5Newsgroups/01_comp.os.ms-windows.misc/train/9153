=>there is a free unix, linux, that ha cc, ~c++, fortran ( f2c ),
=>xwindow and mani other featur besid, with a larg number of util
=>that can be option ad. and there is also a free 386bsd i believ.
=>both these unix's ar quit robust. you can check out comp.os.linux

i dunno about linux, but for 386bsd, don't forget network
(well test, at that), nf, a fast, incred stabl filesystem,
and the list goe on...  8-)

for us 386bsd folk, look in comp.os.386bsd.*.
