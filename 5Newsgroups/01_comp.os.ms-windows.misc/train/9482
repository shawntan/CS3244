well, someon at microsoft told you wrong.  window will us a swap file
larger than the recommend size.  last summer i went to a microsoft
window 3.1 technic workshop and thei distribut a lot of inform
that the gener public might not be awar of.  anywai in the main book
thei hand out thei have a section on "creat larger than recommend
swapfil".  i'll quot the inform

  if you creat a perman swapfil larger than the recommend size, you
  will receiv a messag tell you that window will not us anyth
  larger than the recommend size.  thi error messag is incorrect, we
  will allow the us of the larger swapfil, up to four time the amount
  of ram on your machin.

so as you see, microsoft doe know that the inform is incorrect.  you
probabl just ran into some doofbal who wa new on the job and wa onli
tell you what littl he knew.

be that what it mai, i would realli suggest to everyon to take the
opportun to go to these technic workshop.  thei aren't actual
incred in-depth, but you do get a lot of materi about bug and
optim straight from those in the know.  besid that thei offer
you huge discount on softwar.  if i rememb correctli, you could pick
up word 2.0, excel 4.0, or whatev their present program is for $130.
that is the full blown version, not an upgrad or educ version.  you
could also pick up microsoft offic for $500 or someth like that.  myself
i sprang for word.

well, hope that wa help to someon.  and besid that i hope someon
will go to a workshop and save a littl monei.

and if anyon at microsoft is read thi -- i realli love your product.
i need a job onc i graduat also, can we work someth out?  ;-)

thank,
