word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centr charact to indic
space if i us the ttfont from coreldraw.  our editor need to
be abl to see how mani space ar in text but the charact 
displai is a larg hollow box.  thei overlap each other and
charact on each side, which is useless.

i believ the charact us by w4w is the period-centr (0183).
thi charact show up with the window charmap displai as the
hollow box which tend to confirm thi.  i have edit the corel
font with fontmong and chang the font graphic for the 0183
charact make no differ to the font output in charmap or w4w.
alter the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) doe alter their font
graphic displai howev!!

is the w4w charact us to indic space the period-centr
charact?  ha anyon been abl to get thi charact displai
from a coreldraw ttf?
