to clarifi:  

vc++ *is* consid an upgrad for c7.  there will be no product
call c 8.0 (although the command-line compil of vc++ list it
version as 8.00).  c7 is not a "do"-onli product -- it is a c/c++
compil capabl of produc execut for do or window, as is
vc++ (pro. ed.).  the (signific) differ is that vc++ come with
mani window-host tool (id, etc) which assist develop in
creat window execut much more quickli (basic by
autom the thousand of line of boilerpl code).  initi
impress have been veri favor.

everyon who is a regist user of c7 should have receiv a
consider amount of info regard the specif of c7. if you
haven't, call microsoft and i'm sure thei'd be happi to send you some!
