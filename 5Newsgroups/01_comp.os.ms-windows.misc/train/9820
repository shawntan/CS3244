time for a new discuss, mayb ? i ask in these group some time ago
what about the tc++/ve, and got no answer, so i decid to try. my brother
who live in the us bought and sent it to me, and i'm still try to get
us to it.

befor i put my good/bad point list, consid i am a turbo pascal/do
programm, and sometim try to make someth in unix with c (just
some exercis from univers). i us to make some program in
microsoft c version 5 (!!) becaus we us some third-parti librari
that requir that. 
- i like borland. it seem to me much more easier to us than microsoft,
  special the debugg. i tri to learn codeview sometim, but never
  felt confort with it.
- tc++ v/e seem veri nice to creat simpl app, like the exampl on the
  objectwindow book. so far, no problem. let see next week or so, when i
  will try someth more complex.
- it work nice even in my "weak" machin 386/16mhz, 6 mb ram. 

but.....

- the manual for the resourc workshop seem to be from a differ version 
  from the workshop itself. some of the window that appear on the manual
  have more iten than in the manual.
- i think i will run into troubl sinc i got thi tc++/ve from my brother
  as a present. i didnt want to bui the japanes version becaus 1) i 
  suspect that the manual will be in japanes :-( and 2) i believ it
  will be far more expens here. so he bought it as a present and sent to
  me, i send the registr card to the japanes branch of borland, but...
  who know.

so, i'd like to ask some question for you all;

- i know that there ar some microsoft gui around here in thi group. is
  there anybodi from borland ? is there ani e-mail address that we can 
  contact the technic support ? not for stupid question, but to ask
  for exampl, why the rw manual seem to be differ from the rw itself ?
- is there anybodi els us it around here ?
- will the book of petzold be us for me ? i intend to us rw and protogen
  to make the interfac and then work on the code itself. 

answer to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-window.programm.tool, pleas.

thank in advanc,

rafael.
