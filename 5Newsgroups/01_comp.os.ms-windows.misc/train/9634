i had thi veri same problem, and did 'work around' by turn pariti check off, but that onli
work while i wa in window, and the pariti error would occur immedi after exit
window, howev,the problem turn out to be 3 chip simm vs 9 chip simm.  i can't us 3 chip simm in my 
comput, and when i replac them, the problem vanish, forev.
