hi...

	the best sound convers program i've ever seen is soundtool, which
is sharewar from germani.  i found a copi somewher in wuarchiv.wustl.edu
a long time ago, but i don't know offhand what directori it wa under.  it's
great at convert file of all type, includ mac, next, sun, and
variou pc format... it's also a great player and editor, with variou
special effect that put window' sound record to shame.  it requir a
driver for variou sound card... the onli builtin on is for the pc speaker
(and even that sound pretti good), but if you're just us it to convert
thing, you can convert them in soundtool and then plai them in sound
record.

give it a try!
