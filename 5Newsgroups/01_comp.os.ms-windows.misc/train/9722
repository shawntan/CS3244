no. when the program is run, it load 4 configur file; autoexec.bat,
config.sy, win.ini, and system.ini. there is no open entri on the file
menu. you can onli edit these four file. if you need to edit some other
program's .ini file, us notepad or some other ascii editor.

i wonder whether microsoft intend for sysedit to be us, or if it wa
just a holdov from the test period and thei forgot to take it out. the
reason i think thi is becaus there is absolut no mention in the manual
about thi program, and there is no onlin help for it (just an about entri
under the file menu). the program look like someth that wa intend for
intern us onli. it's kind of a shame, though. it would have made a nice
multi-file replac for notepad.
