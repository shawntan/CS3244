lot of driver ar avail off ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/
driver/video. i've tri two: et4cview.zip and et4turbo.zip. these
give you a choic of turbo and non-turbo driver. the turbo driver
were fast but caus mous problem with my machin (which ha a
diamond speedstar card). i final got turbo driver (wndspeed by
binar) from diamond. amaz. blazingli fast (for a non-acceler
card) and best of all - no gpf's for a month or so...
