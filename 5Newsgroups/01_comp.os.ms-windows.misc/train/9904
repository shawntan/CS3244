mornin' all.  i wa wonderin'.....
i got screenpeac (the screensav, which i think is *veri*
good), and i got a problem with it...
there is an option there, "realiz colour tabl", and if it's
switch on, some wallpap' colour will get *uck up with
some screensav (e.g. the "flashlight" on).  if i turn it off,
howev, it work well, and it's faster, so i have it off.  all's
nice and well.  howev, if i turn it off, then it will be on
again next time i start window.  all the set ar set in the
win.ini file, and i *do* have "save set on exit" select.

also, i tri manual chang the set in the win.ini file
to "n" (for no-->realiz colour tabl), and start window.  it
will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again*
turn the option on.

i tri ad a +r (read-onli) attribut to my win.ini file, and
it work, but my bitmap (wallpap) saver didn't work then.
actual, it's the same applic.  anywya, it didn't work,
sinc it must chang the set at the win.ini file.

so anyon out there got ani answer/sugges/comment for me?

thank, i.a.
