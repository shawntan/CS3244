nathan,
  win31 ha a fix limit of 64k gdi memori, regardless of physic ram
instal, thi is twice that of win30, but not nearli robust enough for
mani develop and power user.
 
us amish launch as your shell, you can reduc gdi memori usag by as
much as 15% over progman, ndw 2, dashboard, and other graphic type icon
base and other shell.  also, nest, and full hot-kei global support
is offer, someth no other shell have at thi time.
