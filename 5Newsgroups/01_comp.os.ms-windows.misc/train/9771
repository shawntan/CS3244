atm will do noth for your truetyp font.  if your truetyp font ar
suffici for your need, don't run atm.  i have a lot of font that i can
instal either as type-1 postscript (under atm) or as truetyp.  i have
notic that:

    1.	truetyp font file ar at least 1/3 larger than their type-1
	equival.  if you ar us a disk compressor, though, be awar
	that truetyp font will compress, wherea type-1 font will not
	(thei ar encrypt).

    2.	with a 300 dpi laser printer, the "artifici bold" version of a
	truetyp font is indistingish from the origin, forc me to
	instal the actual bold (and bold-ital, etc.) variant if i want
	to us them.  type-1 postscript font under atm gener a visual
	distinct bold variant from the base font.  i realiz that the
	artifici bold font that atm gener is aesthet inferior
	to the hand-gener bold truetyp variant, but it is suffici
	for my need, and not have to instal bold variant save me 50%
	on disk space (uncompress).
