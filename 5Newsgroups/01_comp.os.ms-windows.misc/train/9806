i have a .bat file that i run under a window icon.  i have set up a pif
file to run the bat file in exclus mode and to us the entir screen.
the first line of the bat file set an environ variabl.

my problem is that on some of our machin (run ms-do 5.0 and window
3.1 in enhanc mode), the set command in the bat file fail with the
out of environ space error.  i have rais the amount of environ 
space to 2048 byte us the shell command in config.sy so i know that
i am nowher near to run out.  if i just click on the ms-do icon,
i can creat a bunch of environ varibl from the do shell.  the problem
is that on some machin, set the valu of an environ variabl in
a bat file fail.  ha anyon seen such behavior befor?  i see no place in the
pif fail to configur environ space.
