hi,
  have you us mac system 6.x or 7.x? if the answer is posit, you would
know if ms-window is a "matur" os.

  dai ago peopl doubt that ms-window is not a real os. i can see why
thei have such question. ms-window confus mani peopl. microsoft
simul mac, but it did a lousi job.  for exampl:

(1) you can not creat hierarchi group. there is no wai to creat a group
    in a group. (if you know how, pleas tell me.)
(2) too mani system paramet to take care of. 
(3) uncomplet document. it's not easi to find the reason why caus
    an unpredict error.
(4) group delet/file delet
    after delet a group, user have to us file manag to delet file.
    but if user forget to delet some relat file, the disk will be full
    of nonsens file.
(5) share problem
    onc you creat two window do compil and edit in some
    languag (w/o good editor), there will be a share problem. you just
    can not open or save the program if it is load. it make sens to
    prevent from save, but not open.

microsoft try to compromis between do and window, but thei just make 
ms-window a graphic do with capac do mutipl do job; 
the worst thing is thei complic the environ. the orgin purpos
of ms-window should be to simplifi the environ, and make pc easier 
to us.
  
  it's by no mean easi to satisfi everybodi, but if microsoft want to
keep their reput, thei should evalu the user interfac more
carefulli befor product distribut.

  no flame, pleas.
