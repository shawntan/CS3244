thei ar work ok, but your definit in qvtnet.ini and qvthost.rc ar
incorrect (see below).

no, i don't think so. you ar us qvtnet and novel concurr, aren't
you? thei us differ packet type, so qvtnet (tcp/ip) and novel (ipx/spx)
should be abl to coexist just fine. pktmux is requir if you ar us
differ tcp/ip-packag concurr.

there is the first problem: you didn't specifi hostnam, just ip-address.
your file should look like thi:

137.112.5.2        <name of your nameserv>
137.112.199.50     <name of your router>

>thi is the begin of the winqvt.ini file.
>[net]
>name=swartzjh.test.rose-hulman.edu

here you should onli specifi your hostnam, without the domain part.

>router=137.112.199.50

instead, us router=<name of your router>, as specifi in your qvthost.rc
i know the releas note for 3.31 sai that ip address should work also,
but  appar thei don't.

>nameserv=137.112.5.2

here, too, you should us the hostnam of the nameserv instead of the
ip address.

it work fine for me that wai, although i could not specifi more than
on nameserv. the relnot sai it should be possibl to specifi up to
three nameserv, separ by comma, but it didn't work.

hope it help,
richard
