on differ will _probabl_ be the same differ as between os2 and
window 3.x now--on will like have a lot of softwar avail for
it and on won't (emul, with the inevit incompat that
crop up in spite of all the contrari claim, just doesn't count when you
_have_ to us a certain softwar packag that doesn't quit run properli
under the emul...). develop want to channel their resourc toward
a platform that ha a larg instal base, and in a case like that the
platform that is most successfulli _market_ (regardless of it rel
sophist) will win.
