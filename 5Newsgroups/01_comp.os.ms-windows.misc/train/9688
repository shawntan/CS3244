we here at utah state univers cooper extens have been us
w4wg for a while now.  we want to talk to the internet with the mail
packag so we got the smtp gatewai.  you also need a tcp/ip transport
packag on top of that which is utterli stupid but that's what thei
requir to get the smtp gatewai to work.  you need a dedic pc
for the gatewai and if you ar look at remot access you need anoth
dedic pc for the remot mail stuff.  we do not have the remot mail
go but you indic that that is what you want to do.  

there is a glitch somewher in the system though.  i don't know if it
is ms mail, the gatewai or the vax here on campu that is choke in the
mail that is sent.  the scenario is thi.  the outgo mail goe to a
unix system which then rout the mail where it need to go.  if that mail
is rout to the vax, the vax ha problem some time receiv the mail.
most messag do get through thi wai except if someon ha there mail
on the vax forward to some other locat.  that is the main gotcha.
where ever the mail is forward to that person get a messag header
then a messag sai "boudari:= (error garbag code stuff)".  if you
can stai awai from send to a vax you ar ok.  the system peopl
of cours sai that the vax is not the problem, the gatewai is probabl
the problem.  if anyon want to get help it is onli $175.00 for on
support call. (until problem is work out)  phooei to that i sai.  i
am look vigor for a better idea.  

if you go forward on ani of thi and find out anyth knew,  pleas
drop me a note - anyon.  the next itter is suppos to have tcp/ip
built in thei sai........  the netxt itter of w4wg

good luck!!!!!
