hello winnett:

i have seen a great deal of discuss herein on the rel merit of 
ms access and borland paradox/win.  howev, ar there ani user out there 
with experi with the databas packag call "approach".  it ha gotten
a number of veri good review from the variou mag. and it seem like it
would requir less hardwar overhead than paradox.  i have rule out access
becaus some aspect of it ar extrem non-intuit, e.g. requir a
field to alwai have a valu.  i like what i've seen of paradox, but it
seem like the resourc requir ar greater than what i have (386/25 mhz,
6 mb ram).

so, pleas provid me with your thought ar "approach", good and bad.  thank.
