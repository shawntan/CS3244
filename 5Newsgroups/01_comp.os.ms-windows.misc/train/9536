have you tri set file in your config.sy file to a fairli high
number? (i've got mine set to 100; i've seen number from 40 to 100 
recommend). also check your stack statement, stack=9,256 is a good
start point. try increas it if it's alreadi set there (such as
to stack=12,256, etc.). both stack and file have been identifi as
_on_ caus of frequent win3.1 crash.
