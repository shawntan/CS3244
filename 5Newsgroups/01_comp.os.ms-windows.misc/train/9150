     don't bother if you have cpbackup or fastback.  thei all offer option 
not avail in the strip-down ms version (from cp!).  exampl - no 
proprietari format (to save space), probabl no direct dma access, and no 
tape drive!

     you need ms defrag if you us doublespac to work on the compress 
volum.
