i think the purpos the origin poster wa try to serv is to avoid the
signific amount of disk access that window doe on startup.  it's like
it's try to it's bit in wear the damn drive out.  i estim it's onli
read a mb of program & data, but from the perform the drive give, it
sound like thei ar scatter all over the drive (my drive is howev
regularili compress).  what is it that take so much fuss.  perhap if ms 
would take the troubl to optim thi startup process, less peopl would 
be want to find a solut themselv.
