i've been us ms access (still avail from some store for $99.00)
and i am quit pleas with it.  it's rel easi to learn, veri easi
to us and somewhat easi to program.  i highli recomend it, particularli
at $99.00!  i have not us paradox for window, but i don't expect it to
be $30.00 better than access (imho).
