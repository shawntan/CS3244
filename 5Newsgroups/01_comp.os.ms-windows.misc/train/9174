i don't believ irq5 is the problem. i tri a mous on com3, irq4 (the
usual place) and it still did not like it. simpli, window seem to onli
support mice on com1 or com2. the funni part is, though, that
microsoft's own mous driver (8.xx) wa quit happi with my mous
sit on com3. why can't window us the mous driver, or at least
support com3? :-)

i've tri thi too. actual, i want to be abl to us my second
modem (com3/irq5) from window. it still will not talk to that modem. i
creat two profil, amstrad (for my amstrad modem on com1/irq4) and
maestro (for my maestro on com3/irq5). it will not talk to the maestro
at all.

if you have a soundblast pro, it should support irq10 as well.
