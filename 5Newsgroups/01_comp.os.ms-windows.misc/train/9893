ok, i have a 486dx50(isa) w/ diamond stealth vram 1mb.
i wa realli satisfi w/ it perform in window.
but now more and more game need higher frame rate in do' vga,
especi thi new strike command. ;-)
thi stealth vram can onli give me 17.5 fp. ;-( (i us 3dbench).
my winmark wa 6.35 million, i think.

so right now i'm consid to replac it w/ a new card, which hopefulli
can perform approx same w/ my current vram in window and also
can perform do' vga prefer >30fp.

i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someon who compil it
in csipg and it look that speedstar 24x and orchid prodesign 2d-s
ware the fastest for non local bu motherboard.
both can give >30fp in do' vga w/ 486dx2/66.
doe anyon have a winmark for both of those card abov with the processor
type ? which on is the worthiest(not necessarili fastest)?
ani other card recommend is welcom too.

also, if possibl, where can i get 'thi' card for the cheapest? ;-)

thank in advanc, folk!
