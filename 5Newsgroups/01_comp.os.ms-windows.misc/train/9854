(from the window resourc toolkit (for win4workgroup)), add an entri to
your "system.ini" file under the [nonwindowsapp] section:

    commandenvs=nnnn

"thi set the command.com env size, where nnnn must either be 0 or
between 160 and 32768.  a valu of 0 disabl the set.  if thi
valu is too small or too big, it is round up to 160 or down to 32768.
if the valu is less than the current size of the actual environ,
thi set is disabl, as if it were 0.  if you specifi the
environ size in a pif file for command.com, the pif set
overrid thi set.  the default is 0 with msdo version earlier
than 3.2.  otherwis, the default valu is the /e: option in the
shell= command in config.sy.  to set thi valu, you must edit your
system.ini [and reboot]."


i have us thi entri, as well as reli on the default /e: from
the config.sy shell= line, and both give larger environ.  if
you don't us on of these, then the environ pass by window
to each new do box is just a littl bit bigger than the environ
_variabl_ present when window wa start.  (no matter how big
the do env wa, when window start, it truncat all unus space
except for a few byte.)  thi should allow your batch file to run,
but your mileag mai vari.
