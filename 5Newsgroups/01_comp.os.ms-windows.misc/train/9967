i am run window 3.1, window for work group and just load do 6.

what`s happen appear as a graphic problem with file manag.  i've
ad some menubar button but there appear to be a grai box region
that cover the top 2/3'rd of the button row.  

these button ar in a row below the pulldown menu.  the pulldown menu
look fine, and the disk label region look fine, but you onli see the bottom
few pixel of the task button.
