sorri about that - don't want to alarm anyon...

i don't think there is ani correl between the crash and pctool.
i reinstal ami pro, and ran compress again, with no problem.
i think problem mai have been relat to fill my disk until it had
0 byte (!) left while ftping, although i would think it wouldn't
matter sinc ami pro wasn't run at the time, and i made space avail
immedi anywai.
but, whatev, the caus, it is work now.
