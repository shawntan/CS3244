summari: help with chang startup logo


i know thi is probabl a faq, but...

i instal the s/w for my ati graphic card, and it bash my window
logo file.  when i start window now, it ha the 3.0 logo instead of
the 3.1 logo.

i thought the file that control thi were

\window\system\vgalogo.rle
\window\system\vgalogo.lgo	

i restor these file, but it didn't chang the logo.  anyon know what
the correct file ar?
