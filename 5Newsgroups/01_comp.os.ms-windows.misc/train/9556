driver intend for the 5420 or 5422 by mistak.

don't quot me on thi on, but i'd steer clear of the
multi resolut driver that allow you to chang resolut
without exit window.  i think it's buggi.

version 1.3 driver ar due to be releas by cirru soon.
unfortun, their not avail via ftp, you have to dial
up their bb in the usa.  i do thi from nz us a 14.4k modem
to cut down on phone bill.  it took me around 7 minut to 
download the v1.2 driver.


good luck,
