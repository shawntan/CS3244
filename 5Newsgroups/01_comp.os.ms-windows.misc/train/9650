subject: set up three-user account system with wfwg
organ: nyx, public access unix at u. of denver math/cs dept.

i am a novic (at best) in work with pc network, and am in the
process of plan a small account system for a small busi.

the particular need in thi case is for three machin, each in a
differ offic of the same build, each have access to a
window-base account system.

my first thought is to set up ms window for workgroup on each of the
machin (like a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropri ethernet
card and cabl that come with the window for workgroup starter kit (on
addit user kit will be necessari).  it then seem logic to purchas
a simpl multi-user account system, along the line of daceasi or
m.y.o.b., and fire it all up!  the 486 will more or less act as server with
a report/check printer attach to it.
cabl run of 30-40 feet will be necessari for thi setup.

well, thi all seem too easi to me.  would ani of you network guru out
there tell me if i am out of my mind here?  ani and all suggest, howev
trivial, will be immens appreci.  my apolog if thi ha been
brought up befor.

thank!

john
