	first of all, without want to sound nag and bossi, ye it is
a trivial answer and that's perfectli fine ( otherwis how is on suppos
to move up to the complic and challeng question, we net reader so
much enjoi :) ?), and the massiv crosspost of your articl wa not
 justifi...
pleas refer to appropri newsgroup next time (by the wai c.o.msw.misc is
ok :) ). now as far as your problem is concern: try plai around with
the set in the 'font..." dialog box under the window control menu (that
littl squar at the top left corner of the window..).
