repost and summar, for your inform or addit comment.

*** thi is long ***

i have 16mb of memori on my 386sx (25 mhz), an intel math coprocessor, and
a 120mb hard drive with 20mb free (no compress).  i have been run
mathcad 3.1, under window 3.1 in enhanc mode, with a 5mb ram drive,
2mb/1mb smart drive, and no swap file (perman or temporari) for
sever month.

i am interest in the faster mathcad 4.0, but i am concern about report
swap file requir and the legitimaci of mathsoft's claim about increas
speed.

to 386sx user:

  will mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that i us a swap file?

so far, in respons to a less detail descript of my setup, or in
unrel post, the more inform answer, on the net or by e-mail,
appear to be:

* look like i would just need an 8mb swap file, and would need to choos (or  *
