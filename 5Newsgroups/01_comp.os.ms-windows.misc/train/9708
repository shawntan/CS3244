you do not need the sdk. what you need (and can get free) ar

locat: ftp.cica.indiana.edu
index:      /pub/pc/win3/index

first get /pub/pc/win3/upload/what.zip (~1.3m) thi contain the help
compil among other thing. it is free from microsoft.

then get these (i think these ar free too)

dir:	/pub/pc/win3/programr
file:  hag.zip, whag.zip wfwhlp.zip

these ar sharewar

dir:    /pub/pc/win3/util
file:	hwab21.zip, qdhelp.zip, qdtool.zip

dir:	/pub/pc/win3/winword
file:	drhelpev.zip (macro for word 2.0 to convert doc to hlp file).
