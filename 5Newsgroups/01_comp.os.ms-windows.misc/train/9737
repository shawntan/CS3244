gawd, i love window :-)

you'll probabl want to delet ani damag execut and reload them
fresh.  data file should be examin and repair.

you're not stupid.  smartdriv cach thing, and window also run a
swap file which mai contain data also.  all of thi is pretti riski
stuff in a pc environ.

a reason accur predict...


here's a brief descript of how do store file:

there ar three piec to a file.  the directori entri, the fat chain,
and the data area.  you can think of these as a sheet of line
notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3x5 card.

the directori entri (notebook paper) hold the file name, actual size,
and first cluster number.  it also hold some other inform that's not
import right now.

the file alloc tabl (fat) chain (graph paper) tell where to find
the actual data.  each squar of graph paper hold a number.  if the
number is zero, the cluster associ with thi box is avail.  if it
hold a "magic" number, it is either the last piec of a file or a bad
(unus) spot on the disk.  ani other number tell which cluster
contain the next section of the file.

the data area (3x5 card) is where the actual inform is store.
the data area is organ as cluster of a fix size; storag is
dole out in "chunk" of on cluster each.  (in your case, on cluster
is 2048 byte.)  as a cluster is fill, anoth is alloc.

to read a file, you first look at the directori entri to get the
start cluster number.  now you read the data from that cluster.
next, look at the fat entri for the cluster you just read.  thi will
tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.
natur, these number ar usual sequenti, but thei can jump
around and even go backward.  continu read, on cluster at a
time, as you walk thi chain through the fat, until you hit the marker
which sai it's the last cluster in the file.

chkdsk is the do util that check the saniti and coher of
the directori and the fat and can bludgeon most flaw into
submiss.  it doesn't have ani intellig, so you have to
doubl-check anyth it "fix".

now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:

>c:\gfx\vpic46\cvpic.ex
>c:\gfx\vpic46\vpic.txt
>c:\gfx\vpic46\video7.cfg
>c:\gfx\vpic46\orcpro2.cfg
>c:\gfx\vpic46\vga.cfg
>c:\game\goos\bird2.x
>c:\winmisc\adv21\winadv.ex
>   alloc error, size adjust

all of these file have size (accord to the fat) which don't match
the size report in their directori entri.  chkdsk /f will alter
the directori entri to match the fat size.  (in other word,   the
directori entri for cvpic.ex mai sai the file is 64,877 byte long.
but chkdsk found a fat chain of 43 cluster attach to it.  (my number,
obvious, ar made up.))

>   316 lost alloc unit found in 224 chain.
>    647168 byte disk space would be freed

disk space wa found which is alloc in the fat, but is not attach
to ani directori entri.  chkdsk /f give you the option of convert these
"lost chain" to file.  you can then examin the file (file0000.chk
through file0223.chk) and renam or discard them.  or, if you tell
chkdsk _not_ to convert them to file, then those cluster will simpli
be mark "avail" in the fat.


>c:\gfx\vpic46\cvpic.ex
>   is cross link on alloc unit 16133

...

>c:\386spart.par
>   is cross link on alloc unit 16133

these file ar both referenc the _same_ data cluster.  obvious,
on of them (at least) must be wrong.  it's interest to note that
c:\386spart.par is your window swap file...

to fix thi, you should copi each cross-link file to a new name.
thi will "fix" the cross-link by give the file uniqu data space.
now delet the cross-link file.  examin the copi and try to
assembl them properli.  good luck.  (hint:  "miss piec" ar
like to be found in those "lost chain" at the top...)

>  36042752 byte in 1496 user file
>   1564672 byte avail on disk

your disk is pretti close to full.  thi mai be the actual caus of
the problem; perhap window need to expand it swapfil by an
amount which exceed avail disk space...

in ani case, the short summari is that someth trash your fat.
there ar util that can mirror your fat and help repair damag
after someth like thi, but you have to run them _befor_ the
problem occur.  sorri.
