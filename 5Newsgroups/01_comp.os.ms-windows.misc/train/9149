not true! both type 1 and tt font can be of excel qualiti and poor qualiti
at ani size. it all depend on the font's maker and the complex of the glyph
relat to the size and resolut at which thei ar view. probabl the reason
for your opinion/experi that tt is inferior is becaus most tt font on the
market todai have been convert from type 1 outlin to tt either by the font
vendor or end-user us fontograph or fontmong instead of the tt font be
hand-hint to take advantag of the tt hint languag. at best these convert
tt font will be on a par with the type 1 font of it orgin.

truetyp is a much richer and more robust hint languag than type 1 (the hint
of diagon for instanc, which tt doe and type 1 cannot). if you check out the
window 3.1 core font (time, arial, courier, symbol, wingd) you'll see what can
be done with tt. there ar other font out there that have been hand-hint and not
just convert. some of the microsoft tt font pack 2 font ar hint veri well.

again, not true. the charact in a tt or type 1 font depend on the maker. if someon
convert a type 1 font to tt thei'll onli get the charact in the font of orgin. tt
allow for much more flexibl in thi area as well. you can have thousand of glyph
in a tt font file (mac/ps/window/unicod char set) and us the charact appropri
for the particular platform you ar run the font on. for instanc, all or our fontpack
2 tt font have the mac/window char set in them. the metric of the font ar such that
if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.
