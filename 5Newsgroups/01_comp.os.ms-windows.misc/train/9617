sinc run ani gui over a network is go to slow it down by a
fair amount, i expect window nt will be multius onli in the sens
of share filesystem. someon will like write a telnetd for it so
on could run charact-base app, but graphic-base app will have
to be share by run the execut on the local cpu. thi is how
thing ar shape up everywher: client-server architectur ar
take over from the old cpu-termin setup. 

note that the next doe thi: you can alwai telnet into a next and
run charact-base app but you can't run the gui. (yeah, i know
about x-window, just haven't been too impress by it...)..
