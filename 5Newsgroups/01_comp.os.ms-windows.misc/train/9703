	ye, and it's pretti much what thei claim.  i haven't had time to
try all of it.  consid the price, even if you decid you don't like it,
it should be saleabl over the next 2-3 month for what you have in it (onc
the price goe up).  all in all it's veri servic; and in my humbl
opinion, more power than access.
