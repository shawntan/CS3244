i think you mai be chase the wrong problem.  i don't think it is the
function overload at all-- i do that sort of thing all of the time
in bc++ without a hitch.  the big problem i have encount in
port mfc to bc++ is that fact that mfc _depend_ on a coupl of
invalid c++ assumpt.

i have never gotten the _entir_ ctrltest app to run under bc++, but
the reason is that ms make some bad assumpt about the order in
which static/global object ar initi (i.e. some object ar
get access befor thei ar initi).  the problem is in the
owner-draw menu code somewher-- if you comment out that section, all
other piec of ctrltest work fine.

two other major gotcha i have found us mfc under bc++:

- the cfile::openflag enum us hard-code number for the open mode,
  rather than the manifest constant defin in fcntrl.h (which differ
  between msc and bc).

- all of the mfc collect class depend on anoth bad c++
  assumpt-- that a refer to a base object can us be in place
  of a refer to a deriv object (true for pointer, not for
  refer).

i am sure there ar other problem along the same line, but i have
not encount them (yet).  i have not seen mfc 2.0 yet, but i hope
that some of these will be address.  if thei ar not, all of ms's
hype about portabl to other vendor's compil will be just that.

-- 
      if these were my employ's opinion, i wouldn't be post them.
