} veri simpl.  you have to have the mous.com or mous.sy load in do
} befor you run window.  note that you don't need to have these file load
} to us the mous in window.


... and you need a video driver which is complet window 3.1 compat, and
your mous driver ha to be complet compat as well.  not quit so simpl.
(i never could get my logitech mous to work 100% in a do window with my
old paradis card:  now i have a diamond ss24x and the 6.2 mous driver, and
everyth work perfectli).
