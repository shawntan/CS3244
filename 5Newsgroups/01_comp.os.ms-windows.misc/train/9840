a while ago i instal spss for window as part of an evalu. onc
the evalu wa complet i duli delet the softwar from my pc.

unfortun there is still a "ghost" of spss left: when i run
someth like "write" and go to emb an object then "spss chart"
appear on the list of object i'm offer. i look around all
the obviou "ini" file without success. the next thing i tri
wa look for the string "spss chart" in everi file in the 
window directori. it turn up in a file call req.dat (or
reg.dat). unfortun the file wa binari and so i didn't feel
inclin to edit it.

i'd welcom a solut for remov spss from the list of ol server.
