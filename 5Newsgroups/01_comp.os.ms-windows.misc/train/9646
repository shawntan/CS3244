i just got a copi of tobia' manag your monei v9.0.  i have quicken 6,
and it's wonder for some thing, but mym seem to have some featur
that q6 doesn't.  for exampl, q6 doesn't seem to be abl to handl
monthli automat deduct from a check account (you know, a
monthli payment that get electron deduct everi month from
my check account).  or is there someth that i'm not do right,
and q6 can actual do that?  anywai, mym seem to be abl to handl
monthli deduct.  in fact, it can appar do better than that.
that is, you can specifi monthli, bimonthli, quarterli, even yearli.
anywai, is anyon awar of a comparit studi of the two program?
or can someon just give me their own person impress?  mayb
someon who ha us both.  or mayb someon who is familiar with
each could give me a capsul review?  anyth would be greatli
appreci.  if i keep mym, i have to pai for it, and i don't know
whether it's worth do.  if mym is better than q6, of cours i
will keep it.  but if q6 can do everyth mym can do (mayb even
better), i won't.  thank all!

if you post a repli, pleas also cc me.  thank.
