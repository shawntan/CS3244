i believ you have the correct file. i think what you'll have to
do is go back into setup and choos chang video adapt or
whatev it is call. then the trick is choos the same adaptor
you current have. what setup doe is it actual chang the
file win.com whenev you go into it and chang the video
hardwar select. it incorpor the content of vgalogo.rle
into win.com when you do thi. thi trick can also be us to
chang the startup logo into whatev you want it to be.
