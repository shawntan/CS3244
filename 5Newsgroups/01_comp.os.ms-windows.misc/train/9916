i instal window for workgroup on my network and i'm have problem 
map drive in the file-manag.

situat:
if i put lastdriv = z in my config.sy, netx will run but i can't access
drive f: to log in to novel.  
if i don't put lastdriv = z in my config.sy i can't access other w4wg 
drive from the file-manag.

it seem that there should be a wai to make netx work with the lastdriv = 
statement in my config.sy.

i would appreci ani help.  it's probabl an easi problem that all you 
window guru's solv mani mani moon ago...
