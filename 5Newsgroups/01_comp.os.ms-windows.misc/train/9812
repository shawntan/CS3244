i have upload the most recent window driver for the cirru gd5426 
chip base displai card to the upload directori at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). thei're veri recent, i download them from the 
cirru bb (570-226-2365) last night. if you ar unabl to get them there, 
email me and mayb i can upload them to some other site as well.  
i have a local bu base card (vl24 bitblast from micron) but i think 
the driver work with isa card (or at least includ driver for them).

i found the new driver to be a signific improv over the 1.2 version, 
improv my graphic winmark (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although thi could be the result of intent benchmark cheat on 
cirru's part but i don't think so.

from steve gibson's (columnist for info world) graphic card comparison 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) i extract the 
follow for the sake of comparison:

							wintach
             		winbn3.11	word	sprsht	cad	paint	overal
steve's system:
486/33 vlb:
ati graphic ultra pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 vlb:
vl24 bitblast		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


it no viper, but i think it a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ati card and when compar to the other card includ in gibson's review.

micron system owner's, i would be interest to hear your opinion on the 
dtc 2270vl local bu disk control. my system came with a maxtor 7120 
drive (120 mb) and at first wa onli give me disk winmark of about 16 kb/s, 
i am now at 22 kb/s. is thi about as good as it get? i can't get a norton's
sysinfo disk read becaus the contol intercept the call, at 
least that wa what the program said.
