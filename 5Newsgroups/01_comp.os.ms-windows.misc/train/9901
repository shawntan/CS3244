a coupl of week ago i post a question concern
commun
between vb and msaccess us dde. the answer i receiv at
that time
allow me to get a prototyp of my project work. howev,
dure
thi process i have come up with new problem.

1) there seem to be a limit of 255 charact for a dde topic
string. is
thi inher in all dde system or just peculiar to msaccess
or vb?

2) it is easi to queri an access databas from vb us the
dde sql command,
(provid the abov limit is overcom by us short
field and tabl
name) but how is on meant to updat a databas?
   a) a dde sql updat command doe not seem to work.
   b) initi an access macro us a dde execut command
from vb cannot
      be us becaus when the macro request inform from
vb us a
      second dde channel the program dead lock until time-
out occur.
      (the vb to access channel ha to close befor the access
to vb channel
      is initi, i guess.)
   c) access doe not allow vb to dde poke the inform.


   the wai i eventu manag to updat a databas wa by
send kei-
   stroke from vb to access us the sendkei command. thi
techniqu ha
   the problem that access cannot be minimis and it must
alwai be in a
   state readi to respond to the sequenc of kei-stroke vb
send.

ar all the abov statement correct or have i made incorrect
assumpt?
ar there ani better work around to the abov? ar there ani
sign of an
odbc driver for access?
