i believ the beta version of the servic is avail via ftp on 
ftp.cica.indiana.edu
in pub/pc/win3/nt call someth like nwnt.zip

there is an index ascii file there, which list the program in that directori
and what thei do.

unfortun thi beta will also disabl netbeui and tcp/ip over your
primari nic, so if you realli want to run it, get yourself an extra nic and
bind it to that.  

otherwis wait for next releas, like i am.
