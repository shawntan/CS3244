thi isn't entir true. it is true that truetyp font ar
larger than their atm counterpart, but atm font *do* get minim
compress. run stacker 3.0 report gener, i get:

	 file type:      compress ratio:
	 -------------   ------------------
	 *.ttf (truetyp)     1.4:1.0
	 *.pfb (atm)          1.1:1.0
	 *.pfm (atm metric)  11.8:1.0

although the metric file ar small, thei compress quit larg.
and, as you can see, even the regular .pfb file have *some* compress.

so, do the math on on such comparit font file:

ttf time = 83260 byte/1.4 = 59471 byte (compress)
pfb time = 51549 byte/1.1 = 46862 byte (compress)

you still win out, even if the atm time font *isn't* compress.

your mileag mai vari depend on compress program.
