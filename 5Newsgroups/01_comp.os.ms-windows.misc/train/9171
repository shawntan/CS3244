i contact lotu about thi problem todai.  it ha been report previous
and there is a fix.  apparantli the problem onli occur when tab charact
ar us immedi preced the equat frame.  the work around when
equat ar expect to touch the right margin is to delet at least on
preced tab and us space to align the frame (or us set frame where
place w/no text wrap around).  unforutn, onc the page run-on ha
occur you ar hose. so the moral of the stori is us onli space charact
to align equat frame.

hope thi help the rest of you who have alreadi contact me with thi 
problem.
