hi there,

we ar run a 120 node token ring with window 3.1 and novel 3.11.

everi onc in a while, we run into "the black screen of death", a phrase
coin by robert x. cring in a recent infoworld column.  

basic, sometim when you quit window, the screen goe black and
you get a nice littl flash cursor in the top left corner of your
screen.  also, sometim when you exit to do, the same effect occur.
cring hint that microsoft and/or novel ha a patch for window'
virtual interrupt control that  mai solv thi.  neither compani
seem to know what i am talk about when i call them.

ha anyon els notic thi phenomenon?  

is there a fix for it?

ani respons is welcom.
