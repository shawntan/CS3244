i wa at the trenton comput fest and there were mani sourc of
ink refil for the hp and canon, so if you don't like the ink you're us,
you have a choic.  there is a frequent ask question (faq) list
that's repost occasion that report how to refil the cartridg
yourself with ink that ar avail from the stationeri store
instead of a "specialti" ink with the specialti price.

i'm not sure, but i think i found anoth legal sourc of cheap
hypo for inject ink into the cartridg.
more on that when my mail order succe.
