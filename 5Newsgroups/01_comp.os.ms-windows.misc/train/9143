note here: the mk toolkit (for do/window & os/2) give you a good
suit of standard unix util.  there ar other similar system from
other vendor as well.  the emx system for os/2 give you most of the
standard unix system call for recompil your unix program under
os/2.  not quit the same thing as actual run unix program
directli in either case, but emx make os/2 almost as compat with
unix system as mani unix system ar with each other.  and, best of
all, emx is free.  :-)

there is a similar system (go32) for do, but it doesn't work with
window, as far as i know.

should add in the cost for do with both geo and window, neither of
which is a standalon os at thi point.  neither os/2 nor unix requir
do.

btw, two of the best unic i've seen for the pee cee ar unixwar ($300
for the person edit) and linux (free).  so i don't agre that "a
good on cost $400-$700."  :-)

and, if you realli want to check out the variou option avail to
you, you should also look into desqview and desqview/x.

cheer
