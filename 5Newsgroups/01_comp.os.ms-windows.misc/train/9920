for a vga card these ar the correct file but you can't just copi them
back and expect it to work.  you have to creat a new win.com file.  try
the command (you will have to worri about what directori each file is in
sinc i don't know your setup):

copi /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle win.com

(i grab thi from _supercharg window_ by judd robbin--great book)
thi is also how you can put your own logo into the window startup screen.
an rle file is just a special compress bmp file.

hope thi help
