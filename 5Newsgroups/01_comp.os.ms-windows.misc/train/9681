hi,
	we've been have problem on a few setup when print to a
serial printer (dmp or laser). i have us work and window write. the
output is ok from do and if i send plain text output, but anyth
fanci garbl or just doesn't output. the except is output to a
lserjet 4 which 'appear' to be fast enough receiv data, not to
bother about handshak messag. i'm sure i'm not alon in thi. i've
tri most of the print/network manag option i can think of. anyon
had similar problem thei've cure and would like to tell me 'bout it??
thank
