i have a small window program which i can not get to work; 
the program look vagu like thi:

=============================================
char f1[80];

int winmain(...
{
  lstrcpy ((lpstr)f1, "hello");
  ...
}

long far pascal wndproc(...
{
  lstrcpy ((lpstr)f1, "hello");
  ...
}

============================================= 
i am us larg model under window 3.1; after link without
error, the rc program said

sort preload segment and resourc into fast-load section
copi segment 1 (53679 byte)
rc : fatal error rw1031: segment 1 and it
     reloc inform is too larg for load
     optim. make the segment loadoncal or
     rerun rc us the -k switch if the segment must
     be preload.

us the -k switch seem to interfer with the proper function of
the second lstrcpy call... can anybodi explain what is go on and/or
how to fix it?


thank...
