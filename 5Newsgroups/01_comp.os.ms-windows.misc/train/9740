	i assum you're us the driver avail from cica (hp4-v108.zip).
bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel. click on the
"option" button bring up anoth screen of choic. chang the "graphic
mode" from "hp-gl/2" to "raster" and check the box "print truetyp as graphic
(thi is onli avail when you choos "raster"). now you should be abl to
print all your truetyp font correctli. good luck.
