  here is an annoi problem. whenev i save an icon which contain dark
color like dark red or dark purpl, these color ar convert to the
bright color. thi happen with everi icon editor includ the imag
editor that came with sdk. i don't have thi problem with .bmp file
either; onli with .ico file or icon librari. the problem is with
the icon colormap field in the icon file header. check the file
with a binari editor, i can see that the mask ar ok. by edit the
colormap manual (copi from anoth icon that i didn't edit) i can
fix the color. doe anybodi know what mai be caus thi problem?
