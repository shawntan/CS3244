softwar that come togeth with the videoblast
is design to work togeth with the soundblast
(from the same manufactur).

sinc i do not own a soundblast: is there a possibl
to us the pc speaker driver to plai audio file for
the videoblast (.avi = audio video interleav file) ?

i think what i should have is a devic driver for
the media player that control the pc speaker driver
instead of the soundblast card (someth like mcispkr.drv).

ha anybodi heard of such a driver?
or am i on the wrong track?

ani inform on thi appreci!

(pleas send e-mail, sinc i don't watch thi group regularli.)
