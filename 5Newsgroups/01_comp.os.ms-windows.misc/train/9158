crossttalk, it doesn't us the whole window.  i mean, when the softwar's
window size is max, it still scroll around the 2/3 of window.  it doe not
us whole window.  i set "stty row 30", but still the same. scroll at 2/3
from the top of the window.  could anyon tell me how to setup these softwar
to us whole window?
