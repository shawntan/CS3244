hi all,

ha anybodi tri to compil ctrltest from the mfc/sampl directori,
after compil the mfc-lib with bwc ?

seem to me, that bwc isn't abl to distinguish pointer to overload
function.
for exampl, imagin the follow 2 (overload) function:
void same_name ( void ) 
void same_name ( int )
 
after try the whole dai, i think, with bwc it imposs to take the
adress of on of the abov two function and assign it to a properli defin
function pointer. 
am i right ? ha anybodi els had thi problem ?

	thanx
