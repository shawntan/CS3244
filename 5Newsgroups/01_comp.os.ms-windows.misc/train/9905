do you mean the icon _of_ the program group, or the icon of the
individu program _in_ the program group?  i assum you mean the
latter, and the answer is: sure you can.  just click onc (not doubl)
on the applic icon, then alt-f p (file | properti).  click on the
chang icon box and tell it the icon filenam.  or us the brows
sub-select.

english is my nativ languag and i love it.  but don't try to tell me
that it's easi to learn or that it make sens.  if it were, "baselin"
would rhyme with "vaselin".
