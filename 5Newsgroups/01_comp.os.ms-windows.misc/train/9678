walther,
i'd have a look at the maximum resolut the combin of the video card
and screen would have without flicker. i'd onli suggest us the color
screen if it doe 800*600 without flicker. if thi is not too small for
your tast at a 14"....
person i'd prefer the mono-screen as i alwai have quit a few window
open. if you onli run on program at a time or rare switch mayb the
color 'surplu' is worth trade in  the smaller size. if you want to
develop program you will alwai have to check the color. i us a
14" mono screen (worst of both world) and wa surpris how the color look
i choos on a color screen.
 
regard,
olaf winkelhak
