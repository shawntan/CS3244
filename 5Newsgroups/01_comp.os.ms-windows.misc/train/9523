re: what to do after the high speed modem arriv.       edit 01 apr 93

thi articl appli onli to window 3.0 and 3.1, and not to nt, os/2
or do app not run under window.

on of the unadvertis limit of most current window pc is that
their rs-232c (serial, com) perform is serious defici.  almost
everyon who purchas a high-speed modem (v.32bi, v.32, pep or hst)
discov the problem the first time thei try to download a file or accept
an incom fax (at 9600+) after upgrad the modem.  overrun and retri
error abound, even when the onli activ applic is the datacomm or
fax program.  if the transfer complet at all, it mai take even longer
than with the old 2400bp modem.


there ar three reason for the problem:

1. the univers asynchron receiv/transmitt (uart) us in most
   pc ar primit ns8250 devic with singl-byte fifo buffer.  if the
   oper system/driver cannot read and flush each charact at high
   interrupt rate, the next incom charact overwrit the fifo and
   the previou on is lost.  do, be a fairli singl-mind
   environ dure datacomm, can usual keep up. window can't.

2. window ha more oper system overhead than plain do, and
   interrupt often take longer to servic.  overrun ar much more like
   than under do.  as soon as you report to your pc/modem vendor that you
   ar lose data, you mai be advis that "you need to upgrad to a
   16550". more like, sinc there seem to be a conspiraci of ignor
   about thi issu,  you'll get no us advic at all.  most of the
   store-front and mail-order sourc i spoke with in attempt to solv
   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and mani didn't even
   know what a uart wa.

3. even your pc ha ns16550a uart (and ps/2's do), or if you can upgrad
   your mother/com board or add a new com board, you mai still experi
   error and overrun becaus the standard microsoft window com driver
   don't take full advantag of the 16550.  window 3.1 is improv in thi
   regard over 3.0, but i still recommend a driver upgrad.  applic
   like procomm+/win (which is what i us) cannot get around thi problem
   by themselv.

if you have a modem card, you mai not have a problem, as the modem part of
the card can be design to be awar of the state of the uart, and avoid
overrun it; howev, i wouldn't want to bet that the card design
were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 uart if i ever bui a modem
card.  some modem card don't even have convent uart, but if thei
ar to work with standard window driver, thei need to simul on.
us msd.ex (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretend to be.


the hardwar situat.

the uart on most pc com port ar base on nation semiconductor ns8250
or ns16450 chip (or megacel insid vlsi chip where you can't replac
them).  you can id the uart type on your system by run the microsoft
diagnost program \window\msd.ex.  be sure to run it in do *befor*
bring up window.   the window serial api mai prevent msd from
accur identifi a 16550 if you run it from a window do prompt.

the ns16550 uart ha separ 16-byte transmit and receiv fifo with
configur trigger level, and can run reliabl at clock rate up to
460,800 bp, although with current modem technolog, there's no point in
push your luck by go over 115,200 bp. the 16550 ha short access
cycl time than the 16450 or 8250.  the 16550 also ha dma capabl, but
it is not clear that ani pc driver ever us thi.  for more technic info,
see nation semiconductor applic note an-491.

so, what uart compon do you have?

try to locat the uart on your mother board, multi-function i/o card, com
board or isa/mca modem card.  if you can't find a socket compon with
the number "8250" or "16450", your com port ar probabl buri in vlsi,
and you won't be abl to perform a chip replac.  if you can disabl
your vlsi com port (as i chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket
com board.

if you have on or more socket 8250 or 16450 chip, you can bui plug-in
ns16550afn or pc16c550cn (low power cmo version) ic from sever
supplier typic for $9 to $15 each.  the "n" chip is the normal 40-pin
dual-in-line packag.  other style ar avail, but avoid ani ns16550
chip without the "a" (the 16c550c ar presum all ok).

earli ns chip have bug, although nation will reportedli exchang those
of their own manufactur for free.  clone chip ar avail from variou
ic maker other than nation.  the manual for the turbocom driver state
support for the follow (appar equival) chip:
nation semiconductor: 16550a, 16551, 16552
chip&technolog:       82c607
texa instrument:      t16c550a
silicon system:        73m550
vlsi                    16c550
turbocom warn about the pre-"a" ns16550 and western digit 16c550,
sai that problem have been report with earli ibm ps/2 55sx and 70
system (ibm reportedli will upgrad them).

if you don't have socket 8250/16450 chip, you'll need to bui an after-
market com or multi-function board. if thi is a modem card situat, you
mai be hose. to add a new com or multi-function card, you'll need to
either disabl the com1/2 port(s) you ar replac, or re-assign them to
com3/4 (although watch out for irq conflict without turbocom).

although cheaper card ar avail, in the interest of get the
problem solv quickli i elect bui the modular circuit technolog
mct-aio+ card from:

the mct-aio+ (and the "+" is import) sell for $89.95.  it is an 8-bit

i have no person experi with ani of the firm except jdr.

meanwhil, back at the mct card from jdr... i onli need two serial port,
and am run out of irq on my pc, so i disabl my built-in vlsi-base
8250 port. howev, with the turbocom driver (below), i could have set
the intern as com3 and 4, us irq share.


the softwar situat

simpli upgrad to 16550 uart will not complet solv common overrun
problem.  the standard ms serial driver don't take full advantag of the
16550. the window 3.0 driver ar even less capabl, and the window 3.1
driver have the follow limit:
 - thei enabl onli the receiv fifo, and onli at rate abov 2400 bp.
 - thei never enabl the transmit fifo, which  result in an interrupt
   rate of 10x dure upload.
 - thei set the trigger level at 14 byte (too high - it's easi for 2
   more byte to arriv befor the driver can read the fifo).
 - the port menu of the control panel onli allow speed up to 19200.
   with a v.32bi modem,  spars data and text can easili compress 3:1
   or more, suggest that a host dte connect rate of 57,600 bp would
   be effect.
 - the api won't accept rate abov "cbr_128000".
 - the api won't let do program know there is a 16550 there, and even
   if it did, do program that aren't 16550-awar get littl benefit
   from a 16550 port with the standard driver.
 - thei don't allow irq share for com3,4.
 - the bio doesn't initi com3,4 properli in mani system.
 - window provid no workaround for app that don't provid port
   speed option abov 19200 bp.

these problem ar reportedli not solv in window nt or do 6.0, and mai
or mai not be address in ani window releas after 3.1 (but befor 4.0).
rumor suggest thei "mai" be solv in window "4.0".

you can get replac driver that solv all of those problem by bui
a copi of "turbocom", current version 1.2, from:

price wa around $50 as i recal.  bio-eng is not set up to accept credit
card, so i had to send a check.  egghead and 1-800-softwar list turbocom
but as far as i know, thei don't stock it.  bio is not a softwar compani
per se.  thei appar need reliabl hi-speed serial connect for
an in-hous instrument applic, wrote their own driver, discov a
market for it, revis it to be a gener purpos com driver suit. thei
recent upgrad it for window 3.1.  it is run-time licens.

i now have my host (dte) connect rate set to 57,600 bp most of  my
datacomm app, and i am have zero problem with download. i routin
see transfer rate that exce 2,000 bp. i am also us 115,200 bp
when link an hp95lx to my pc, with lossless bi-direct i/o.
upload to variou remot system ar anoth matter, becaus mani host
ar still us antiqu uart and driver.

note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the window 3.1 port menu
in control panel will allow in configur a com port.  turbocom get
around thi by allow you to specifi, on each port, a factor that will
set the real uart rate to a multipl of the rate pass through the
window api and dialog box.

i also have ct/rt hardwar flow control enabl, and i suggest that you
do the same.  even if you onli ever transfer 7-bit ascii data, xon/xoff is
not a suffici reliabl method of flow control.  the inform (dec)
standard for xon/xoff hysteresi is that the sender mai transmit anoth
16 (ye, sixteen) byte after receipt of the xoff from the receiv
system or devic.  the 16 byte fifo in the 16550 is clearli not big enough
to let us reli exclus on xon/xoff.  a well-respect datacomm
engin ha inform me that the 16550's can't realli do ct/rt all
by itself in the do/window environ, so us data rate abov
115,200 mai still be riski.

even with hardwar flow control, a 16550 with turbocom can still
experi overrun in veri busi system, with lot of app run and
seriou swap in progress. if thi is your situat, you mai need to
bui a co-process com board, but thi will cost you more than a
16550/turbocom upgrad.  a review of two such board, and a review of
turbocom, can be found in the feb'93 issu of "window sourc" magazin.
i suggest try a 16550/turbocom upgrad first, and experi with
process prioriti and time slice if you ar a "power user" whose
thrash system still run into comm problem.


close soapbox comment

the state of rs-232c serial datacomm support is an embarrass across
the comput industri.  becaus it is the oldest standard i/o interfac,
the job of design hardwar and write softwar often seem to be
assign to the least senior or lowest rank engin at comput
compani.  the design of the averag serial port is at least ten year
behind the state of the art. in my last job, with a major workstat
vendor, i lobbi for improv serial port when thei were do the
initi design of a new system.  that famili of machin wa
subsequ introduc with 16550 port.  howev, thi is the
except.  few comput compani seem to have ani champion for decent
i/o.

you mai as well learn what you can about serial i/o, becaus thi
situat show no sign of improv soon.  when v.fast arriv, i expect
cri of outrag from window user world-wide whose 8250 pc "sort of"
work todai with v.32, but will fail miser with v.fast.  without a
hardwar-buffer uart (like the 16550) and without softwar driver that
us that uart to best advantag, a v.fast modem will be a wast of monei.
