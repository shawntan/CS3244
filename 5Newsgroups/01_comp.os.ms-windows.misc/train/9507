just a thought on resourc,  it is veri import if you do us a
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it us resourc.  i have
us glockenspeil commonview under motif and os2.  i wrote a resourc
convert from os2 to motif, but it realli wasn't too easi, especi
the name scheme. in motif you cannot renam control/widget.
with window you can call the ok button id_ok in everi instanc,
thi doesn't work for motif, you'd have to call it dialog1_ok,
and motif expect a text string rather than a number.  so 
your constructor should know how to convert a #defin into the
proper resourc identifi.
i'd check on how the toolkit expect name, and that if it doe
us resourc, that is us resourc for all platform you intend to
port to. ( by the wai, i would never us commonview or glockenspiel
for anyth )
