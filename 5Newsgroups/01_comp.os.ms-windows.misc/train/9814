i just bought a bj-200 printer a coupl of dai ago.  i compar it to the 
sampl print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp wasn't for me.  the 
bj-200 is pretti fast and realli print with good qualiti.  i can compar it 
with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and thei look almost ident (
depend on the kind of paper).  i don't have problem with the ink not 
be dry, it seem to dry veri fast.  probabl within a second.  sinc 
canon is give a $50 rebat until the end of mai, it is realli a good bui.
