no.  i recent bought an lc ii with a 14" monitor.  the monitor come with
the type of power cabl that plug into the switch outlet on the back of
most larger mac.  sinc the lc ii doesn't have on of these outlet, there
wa an extra standard power cabl includ with the comput for us with
the monitor.  but it wa in the comput box, not the monitor box.  it's
not as if the cabl ar particularli expens, though.  $10-$15 at the
most.
