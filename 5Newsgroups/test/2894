is there a hot-kei for the window 3.1 screen saver util?  if not, is
there an easi wai to creat on?  the reason that i need on is that my
dad's compani is anal retent about leav a comput while the
inform can be access so the employe ar not allow to walk awai
from the comput until the screen saver kick in (as if that is terribl
secur).  also, the system manag won't let ani softwar be ad so 
anoth program such as lock32.zip from cica or a differ screen saver
is out.

thank for ani and all help.
