we ar research what support there is on variou platform for applic
to us multi-byte charact (e.g., japanes kanji).  we know that unix
and x window can contain support for the i18n standard (depend on level
and platform).  what support for i18n or wide charact exist on the mac, 
window 3.1 and window nt?
