i don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the mac superdr can  
read ms-do disk (can it??) then you can transfer file between the next and  
a mac by us ms-do format disk sinc the next *can* read/write that  
format.  and if you're interest in transfer file, you can also do it  
over the serial port us kermit.
