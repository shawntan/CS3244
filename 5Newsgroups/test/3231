well,

    you can alwai try and find a pc dealer who sell guarante memori.
i work at a compani grow at 40% a year, we have on order hundr
of comput per year.  it never fail, machin come in with bad simm.
now for those of you who ar wonder just why your pc or mac just crash
i can tell you i alwai thought it wa the incompet ass who wrote or
design the softwar.
    well, i don't think that wai anymor, especi with the result i
have gotten with replac bad simm in my own machin and other at work.
the moral to thi stori is to make sure your memori is good.  i would
be will to bet lot of you out there have simm with either soft
or hard error on them and you don't even know about it, but everi onc
in awhil those bad simm just make your life hell.
   
i just got plain sick of deal with peopl complaint that thier machin
just crash and thei lost thier work.  in case your wonder, or if you
haven't alreadi guess i work in an is depart.  servic is a do or die
perog in thi line of work, so the moral is:  have your memori test
with a simm hardwar tester...and no i don't mean the simpl littl softwar
program that you can run in your machin.  simm ar complic littl
beast and thei need special hardwar to test them effect.

if ani of you ar interest in get on of these nifti littl devic
which ar not cheap, write me back.  thei make life a littl bit easier, and
besid thei pai for themselv in a short time from the loss of product
peopl would have to deal with when thier machin commit suicid.
