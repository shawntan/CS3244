hello,
    i'm try to us the bio timer interrupt (which occur everi .055
second, or 18.2 time a second) to time peopl's respons time, in a
psycholog experi, and the respons time ar on the order of .01
second. is there ani wai i can get better precis than by count
tick? or can i make the tick occur more frequent? i'm try to do
thi in do 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if thi could also work
on our old 8086 machin run do 2.1 (i know, i know, i don't like
them ani more than you do) but thi is by no mean a requir, just a
possibl. 
    so, basic, ani inform on the bio tick scheme and the
relat inrterruot would be appreci, as well as ani inform on
altern wai of improv accuraci. email is prefer, as i'm
plan on post thi to a few board, and i don't read all of them.
thank

joe
