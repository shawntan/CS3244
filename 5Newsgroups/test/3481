on a more cheer note, perhap hacker/hack isn't complet dead.

as someon els said, take the gnu offer for exampl - free, redistribut and 
often better than the commerci stuff.  take also the number of paper publish
everi year in all the field of comput scienc - the vast major of these paper
detail origin work of real, often except merit - and the author ar share
thi knowledg.

have fun,
