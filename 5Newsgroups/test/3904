doe anybodi have a data-sheet handli for the abov-mention card?  i
bought on, san manual at a local surplu shop, and want to try it out
with the crywyr packet driver suit.  

the irq and interfac-select jumper ar pretti straightforward, but i
don't grok the set of w10-w18 (also label a15 through a18).
could somebodi tell me which set of these four jumper correspond
to what i/o address?

is there anyth els about thi card i should know, befor i
plug&plai?
