hi! i've just instal the new xarchi 2.0.1 and it all work
fine, except:

on our grayscal xterm the custom icon compil into the
program don't work at all, but on the bw termin it work fine.
i can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't
give the neat-o chang when busi action. (other program with
similar action, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)

the x-interfac author, georg ferguson, suggest it might be a
problem with the x intrins, but isn't will to hack around
to fix it himself. but i know zero about x program, so i
don't think i can find it. 

doe anyon out there know an obviou fix for the problem?
