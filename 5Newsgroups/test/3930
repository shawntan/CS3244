rational
---------
the rational for thi propos is a need for those interest or
involv in the publish of cdrom materi to have a forum for
the discuss relat to their need. at the moment the main fora
for such discuss ar in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither
of which have publish as their focu. some list serv the
gener cdrom commun with focus on librari, govern and
network usag, and until sever week ago none were devot 
to publish (cdpub ha just been setup). in ani case a list is not,
and ought not, be a replac for regular usenet newsgroup.
 
the reason for the divis into three group is a natur
partit of interest between the hardwar and softwar topic,
and between the two main focal point of softwar, i.e. fulltext
and multimedia publish. topic such as cdrom xa, cdi, cd-r, 
photo cd and other relat format would be includ as well. 
topic relat to cdrom publish that ar neither clearli
hardwar or softwar relat such as book, copyright issu and
other legal matter, packag, distribut, could be includ in
the purvu of comp.publish.cdrom.softwar, as would ani other
nonhardwar or multimedia topic that relat in some wai to cdrom
publish, in ani format, and is appropri to the internet.
 
the main focu of comp.publish.cdrom.softwar would be topic such as
index and retriev softwar, premast softwar, cdrom
simul softwar, hypertext, sgml, scan and imag
softwar, data captur softwar, data clean up, compress,
encrypt etc as relat to publish cdrom.
 
the main focu of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be softwar that
aid in the multimedia author and publish process - audio and
video.
 
the main focu of comp.publish.cdrom.hardwar would be hardwar that
relat to cdrom publish, as well as hardwar for data captur,
such as all sort of scanner and data captur hardwar, as well as
inform that publish need to know about the hardwar that
the intend endus will util (the hardwar that will
eventu plai the publish cdrom) includ network for cdrom.
 
note
-----
these group ar not to be us for topic such as review or
question relat to alreadi publish cdrom or review or
question relat to gener purpos cdrom drive and the like.
request for help in instal a cdrom drive and other gener
topic should be direct to other fora. question about cdrom
mount on lan should be direct to bit.listserv.cdromlan.
