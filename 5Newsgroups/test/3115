i have also move on to a 66.6 mhz clock. thu far not problem. i'm not totallysurpris as i've had q700 run at 35.4 mhz (cpu clock speed) us a vso. my
25 mhz rate daystar quadracach got veri hot at 32 mhz and would fail previous. i glu on a piec of aluminum stock to the hi speed ram chip and it run
cool without problem at 33.3 mhz. the combin is faster than a q950.
