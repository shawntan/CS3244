in the list you mention, tgif handl everyth except rotat and
ani size text.  it onli support 90 degre rotat.  current, it
support 11 (x11r4 standard) font size.  howev, it allow arbitrari
scale of the entir draw.  effect, it allow ani font size, but
you can onli have 11 differ size per draw.

tgif take up 850k (compil with -o option) on a sparcstat.  i wa told
that it compil under linux, but i haven't tri it yet.  it work with
both color and monochrom x.
