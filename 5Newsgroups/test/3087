hello net.peopl,

we have a laserwrit select 310 (standard 1.5mb ram) connect to an lc
iii (4/80).

the print driver cannot find ani adob type 1 font or ani truetyp font
in the system.

the connect to the printer and the driver instal ar correct
but thi 310 printer still refus to find font and work correctli out
of the box.

imho, an appl product not work out of the box is a shame event.

the instal disk for the printer instal: lw select 310 driver v 1.0,
printmonitor v 7.1 and background v 3.1 (!) on a system 7.1 lc iii.

becaus we realli need some help on thi on.

thank,
