don't be silli.

us the sound manag on a quadra is veri well, but us sm on
ani of the low-end machin doesn't simpli work for a decent action
game sinc it just steal too much time from the cpu. thi is
a fact. by write directli to the hardwar on an se, it is
possibl to have 4 simultan channel of sampl sound (11khz) for
a cost of approx. 8000 cycl. exactli how would you do that us
the sm, prai tell?

the correct thing to do is to us the sm on the machin that can
carri that extra load us the sm mean, and to write directli
to the sound hardwar on the machin that can't. it's not the
polit correct thing, but from the develop' point of
view it is.
