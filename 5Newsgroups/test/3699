if you instal x lib xt by redefin projectroot, you will find that
 dure the instal it recompil on of the file in x lib that doe the
search for xkeysmdb and emb the search path for the file base on whatev
projectroot wa defin. to confirm thi what happen, becaus i'm 
guess, go to mit/lib/x and do
string xstrkeysym.o | egrep xkeysymdb
