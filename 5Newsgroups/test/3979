well, i have a differ stori to recount.  i attempt to low-level format a
wd 43mb disk about a year ago.  when i understood my error, i contact wd.
thei told me that i hadn't hurt the drive and that i should just run fdisk and
format/s on it.  it wa fine.  also, i understand that western digit's bb
mai have some low-level format routin specif avail for id
drive.  you probabl need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.
