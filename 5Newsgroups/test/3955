i ran out of time on my last repli to thi string and i don't
know if it wa sent or not but. i have never heard of anyon that
had to return someth in the 30 grace peri that had a problem
at all with midwest micro. thei mai of thought that you didn't
know what you were do and suggest how to correct the problem.
but it sound as you didn't give them much of a chanc to correct
thing at all. the fact that the ppi work okai for you is becaus
it is setup more for the no noth user that can't understand the
instruct and the command to configur it to hi/her system.
when you find out thing like the fact the the ec led that look like
you have connect to anoth ec modem, doesn't reali sai that.
but that it onli tell you that you have ec turn on, on your modem.
i think that these led ar noth more that just light to hype up
the product. just like i bet someon took home a few extra $$$
in the last year for give the ppi modem the pc-magazin award
of the year. not so for the stash (12) of them that i saw on my test
bench. i could go on for hour at no end as to all of the problem
that i found with the ppi modem but i will try to control myself.
i will not even go into the 6 week it took ppi to credit my card
back for the modem after thei had receiv them back...no i will
not go into that on nor will i go into talk to the parent co.
co from hay. i'll just sai i hope you like your new modem and
mayb someon that can understand how to setup a modem will get
the on that you sent back, mayb a good friend of mine i hope!
