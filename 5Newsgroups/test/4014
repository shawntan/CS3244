doe anyon know if there ar ani problem (or if it's possibl)
ad a third hard drive(scsi) to a do pc.

i current have a 386 pc with  futur domain scsi board  and  2
maxtor  scsi  drive  instal.  thei work great, i haven't had
ani problem!

well, now i want more disk space and went out and  got   anoth
(larger)  scsi   hard  disk  think all i had to do wa add it
to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  ha  3  connector)   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to format/initi the disk.

that didn't happen.  when the pc boot, the  scsi  prom   shoot
back   the  devic   that   ar  attach  to  the board[target
0/target1/target2].  all three disk ar seen.

when i run the do fdisk program to format the disk, i choos to
select anoth  disk(option  5(do6)) and voila, it's not there.
the first two disk show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
no-where to be found....



argh!

idea anyon?????

thank in advanc!
