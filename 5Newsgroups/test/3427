don't mind if i do.
as someon who would _love_ to see xv go to 24 bit, thi
would be plenti for me.

    a) xv can load a 24 bit imag, and displai it in all it's
24 bit glori on 24 bit x displai.
    b) all other oper (crop, dither, smooth, etc.) ar not
support on 24 bit imag.

how hard would thi be?
