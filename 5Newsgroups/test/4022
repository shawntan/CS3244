i have had a scsi and id drive work togeth for some year now.
scsi is supposedli pretti transpar to other type of drive
(esdi,rll,id,etc) - but oftentim you need to get the correct driver
to get it to work with odd environ.

for inform purpos, i had:

st-01 card + st296n drive and a maxtor 212a drive with gener id
control run togeth. i have also had the same scsi setup work
in combin with a rll drive, the st251-1 drive.
