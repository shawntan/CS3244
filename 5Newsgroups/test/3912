lpt port don't recogn baud, pariti, etc. set.  you might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  try thi: attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the pc.  us the mode command to set
the com port set.  try

c>mode com1,9600,n,8,1

to set the port paramet.  then us the mode command to redirect the
printer port lpt1 like thi:

c>mode lpt1=com1

thi should work.  good luck!
