[ thi would make me a bit suspect of mr. ramsei's qualif
as a self-style "expert", in fact, when i read about anybodi
us virtual memori regularli i kind of wonder ... ;-) ]

ye, on can sometim get awai with run a newer rom (of the 
correct size, obvious) in an older machin, but on should be 
prepar for problem if run softwar that check for machin 
type rather than rom trap avail and then draw incorrect 
conclus when special-case - especi time-depend
and driver-relat stuff.

in thi particular case i see no reason to go to the troubl 
of rom-swap.  the appl 32-bit enabl ha problem, but
mode32 work just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.

>doe anyon know of a sourc for these rom?  

sure.  bui a us iici motherboard.  call pre-own electron,
shreve, or other part dealer (see the back of comput shopper
or on of the mac trade for phone number) and ask for a price
on a iici rom.  everyth ha a price.  if you happen to find
somebodi who salvag a iici with a dead motherboard, you might
get a decent price.  there is probabl a market for us mother-
board as well, so thei might sell a rom anywai.

>needless to sai, i'm interest in purchas such a rom.  what would
>be a reason price to offer?

ask for a quot and then try offer less?  pre-own and
shreve have been known to dicker.  their ad in variou trade
magazin often list consider differ price for the 
same item, and their phone quot tend to vari as well.

still, i'm not awar of ani technic reason for upgrad 
the rom in a iix.
