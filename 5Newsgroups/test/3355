 i have a copi of 'the earth-from space' on my wall that i purchas
from space shot, inc. (la, ca  (800) 272-2779).  as print on the
poster, the imag wa creat by tom van sant and the geospher project.
the imag is copyright, so i doubt that you'll find it legal in
the public domain.  part of the proce from the sale of the imag go to the 
geospher project (an environment educ thing), and the cost is
nomin, so crack a 20 and bui on!  also, i don't think it's alwai
safe to assum that just becaus the govern 'fund' a project, ani
product will be provid for free.  mani govern agenc (nasa, noaa)
and some privat group (nation geograph) provid assist to the
geospher project.  thi collabor seem to be mostli orient to
educ the public, rather than pure research.
