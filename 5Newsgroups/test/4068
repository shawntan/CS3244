i post almost the same bad experi with  midwest micro but our
%^*^&*^&* new program onli sent on paragraph out of the middl. in
addit to the fact that:
(a) the modem (i had order two) wouldn't work as document
and
(b) the tech person had no clue as to how it should work,
it also turn out that:
(c) on of the two modem thei sent wa clearli us but the tech
thought that wa standard practic and
(d) the modem made all three of my floppi drive quit work and
my cm250 tape drive start run awai.

bob,
i have walk into micro center here in the cleveland area and bought
a new track ball and pick the onli on that wa seal in plastic
rap. onli to get it home and op it up to find a good year old us
dirti old track ball with a warranti card for some softwar packag.

i would never even think of instal anyth that look like
it wa us at all. you should of call medwest micro
and made them do a pu pull tag on it. thei would of pick it up
and sent you out a ner on the same dai.
