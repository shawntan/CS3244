can anyon tell me the procedur for hook a person laserwrit ntr
serial to a mac?  the document sai it can be done, but i'm not sure of
the correct switch set to us out of the given non-appletalk switch
option.  also, will i need to instal a new driver so that the chooser know
the printer is hook up directli (not network)?

thank a lot,
ross
