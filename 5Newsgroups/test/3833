	i got a few request ask for a summari, so i'll attempt on
here:


	here's the on i know of:

	wind/u		- bristol technolog

	hunter sdk	- hunter system

	mainwin		- mainsoft

	libwxm          - visual solut


	hunter 

	the compani is go through some big chang.  i expect
to eventu see the hunter sdk pop up with a new name.  at the moment, it
is difficult to get phone call return and otherwis obtain info.
hopefulli thei will post someth about themselv onc thing settl down. 

	visual solut

	libwxm is a product that i just heard about.  thei don't
yet support mdi or mfc.  libwxm wa us to port vissim, a mathemat
model packag.  doe nativ motif widget, like wind/u from bristol.
contact carri lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  she's veri help.

	mainsoft

	thi translat window sourc to a unix execut that
can switch off between a window or quasi-motif look and feel at
runtim.  thei skip the xt and xm (motif) x toolkit level and go
straight to xlib.  thei don't yet support mfc.  thei're at 415 896 0708.

	bristol

	thi compani that seem to be on the right track.  wind/u us
xlib/xt/xm to give a *real* motif app.  thei seem to be do the most work
in try to support thing like dde, common dialog, and more on the horizon.
my contact there is knowledg, respond to my email, and wrote an exampl
program for me show how to obtain x widget from window handl.
thei're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.
