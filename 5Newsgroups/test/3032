i have a logitech 256grai hand scanner from a pc.  i'm wonder if anyon
ha been success in connect the scanner to a mac?  it ha the same
connector and is a serial devic on the pc.  i can imagin the pin conigur would need to change, but i'm not sure if the signal level would be correct,
and if the mac s/w would work with it.  

of cours the manual sai noth about the interfac, connector layout or
anyth h/w-ish!

ani idea??


thanx,

steve
