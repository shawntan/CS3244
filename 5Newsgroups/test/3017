last week's macweek articl by ric ford indic that david ramsei's
mac iix ha been run nice with a mac iici rom in it, offer
clean 32-bit rom code (liber hi iix from the virtual memori
nightmar caus by appl's 32-bit system enabl).

doe anyon know of a sourc for these rom?  is it okai for a
remanufactur to resel onli rom chip from us machin?  i know that
copi cannot be made, but it seem to me that it would be okai to
resel the origin us rom.  (after all, resel a us comput
involv the sale of the rom anywai, so what's the differ?).

needless to sai, i'm interest in purchas such a rom.  what would
be a reason price to offer?
