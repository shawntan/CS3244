paintshop pro for window is a fantast product.  it can handl tiff, gif,
bmp, pcx, and mani other format, displai them and convert between
them.  there is a sharewar version of the program; i assum it's avail
in the window area of the standard anonym ftp locat (i'd try
ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  log in as ftp, us your usernam as a password,
and look for a program call psp101.ex or someth like that.  i have
the regist version, and the onli major differ i can detect is that
the unregist version pop up a messag when you start the program
ask you to pleas regist it.

onc again, fantast softwar.  up to 24 bit, huge imag, everyth.
