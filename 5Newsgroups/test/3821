it is true that the man page for pageview doe not sai that the file need
to be dsc compliant.  that is the fault of the left hand not know what the
right hand is do at sun.  i wa inform by a sun employe that the pageview
program doe requir dsc compliant postscript.  there wa the possibl that
it wa go to be chang so that if the file wasn't dsc compliant that it
would stop at each showpag.  i believ that thi method would preclud be
abl to go backward and forward through the file, i.e., you could onli go
forward to the next showpag.  thi isn't in ow3.0 pageview, but mayb it is
in the solari 2.x version of ow (ow 3.1?).

in ani event, i find pageview extrem us.  sinc all of the postscript
that i produc is dsc compliant, i don't have ani problem.
