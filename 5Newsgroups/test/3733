like thi...

...then continu read (content of the current releas's readm):

xm++ is a user interfac framework for the c++ languag built upon x11
and the x-toolkit. it is design to be a simpl and intuit program
interfac to access the function of commonli us widget.
xm++ wa initi creat for the motif widget set, now support for the
athena widget wa ad. applic creat with xm++ run in both
environ without chang, although mani nice featur ar onli
avail when us motif.
in some situat xm++ extend the underli toolkit (i.e. provid
a combobox borrow from ms-window), but never tri to replac it -
data of user interfac object is left to the widget and onli duplic
in rare case.

xm++ ha noth common with motif++ besid the gener idea to
encapsul motif widget in c++ object and the '++' in it's name. mani
idea for the xm++ architectur came from digitalk's smalltalk version,
which provid an easi to us framework for window/pm/mac applic
(in the veri first time of develop i us the window dialog editor and
a simpl parser to creat similar smalltalk and xm++ dialog :-).

top level object in xm++:
* 'window', 'systemdialog' and 'toolbox' which us the automat layout
  featur of variou composit widget in motif and xaw
* 'userdialog' which can be individu laid out with a user interfac
  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is includ in thi
  distribut)

control (children of top level object):
'statictext', 'staticimag', 'pushbutton', 'checkbox', 'radiobutton',
'edit', 'listbox', 'combobox', 'groupbox', 'panearea', 'draw', 'toolbar'

the staticimag and all the button class can displai b/w (x-bitmap
format) or color (gif format) pictur as an altern to a label text.

event handl is done by a simpl but power mechan which redirect
xt callback to member function of xm++ object.


commoninteract(ii) is built upon the xm++ draw class and provid
compon for build direct manipul applic. is is a veri
simplifi implement of some featur from the commoninteract system
(research project of our institut in 1991), an approach to defin a
softwar achitectur for implement direct manipul applic
with multipl interact media (i.e. sound, altern input devic).
if you ar interrest, look into the june 1993 issu of the joop (sig
public - journal of object orient program) - there should be
our paper about commoninteract (but be awar, that it is our 'state of
the art' from 1991).
commoninteract(ii) is still undocu and is includ becaus it wa
us to implement the dialog editor. it current support onli draw
primit (line, rectangl, circl...), but we plan to extend it to
support bitmap and some control also.
known problem: the xm++ draw class ha no redraw strategi (alwai
redraw the whole window, even after minim chang like select an
object), thi look veri ugli on slow displai and should be fix.


about thi first releas:

xm++ is still incomplet and ha a lot of bug but we ar us it here
for smaller applic which ar run without problem. so i think
i can call it a 'beta releas' which can be us to develop applic
for ani non-critic purpos.
commoninteract mai be call a 'pre alpha releas'. it's develop will
be continu thi year becaus we plan to us it for anoth research
project here. besid incomplet and the redraw problem it seem
to be stabl and can be us for experiment applic.

platform: thi releas wa compil and test on:
  hp9000/720 run hp-ux 8.07
  sun sparc run suno releas 4.1.1
  pc-at386 run linux v0.99pl6

caution: although the whole stuff wa initi develop us an at&t
standard c++ compil - thi releas is test onli with gnu g++ 2.3.3 or
abov (the next releas will be test with both compil).

where to get it:
================

i have upload it on: export.lc.mit.edu as: /contrib/xm++.0.5.tar.z

(send a mail, if you cannot find it there, e-mail addr. below)

where to find more inform:
===============================

the .../doc directori contain
   instal - how to build the librari and exampl
   readm.gnu - problem and limit when us gnu g++ (read!!)
   usersguid.txt - a tutori how to us xm++
   refer.txt - a first try of a xm++ class refer manual

the readm file in the .../sampl give a brief descript of
each of the seven sampl.


xm++/commoninteract is free softwar for ani non-profit purpos,
see the file .../lib/copyright for detail.
