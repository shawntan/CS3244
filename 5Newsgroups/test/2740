well, i got  winzip from cica (don't know which version, but i think
it's the latest, as thi is not long ago), and i wa initi imress.
but here's the low-down:

winzip is a *great* progra, *as long as you onli unzip*.  it let you
vew file, unzip onli select file, and even put the file in a
/checkout directori, and creat a "checkout" .grp and group if you want
to check the program out.  it even prompt for delet of these on
exit, if you didn;t like the program.

*howev* (big howev over here).  i have problem zip.  i don't
konw specif on thi, or ammount of consist, but sometim when i
"zip" a few file, or add a file to a .zip, do will violat someth
or other, and i'll be ask (in a kind, micro$oft kind of wai) to quit
all applic, quit window, and restart my comput.  i don't know
(as i said) how consist thi is, as i jdont' zip much (and when i do,
now i just go to do and us it from there, or just us the "run" cmd)
but i *do* know it's happen when i ad file to an exist .zip
file, *and* when i creat a new .zip file, us select file onli.
i don't know if it's happen when i zip an entir dir.

still, it ha a rather nice interfac, and quit us "unzip"ing
function.  if the abov is fix, i'll be the first to regist the new
ver.  (as for now, a good old, "run-->unzip *.zip" will work.

(ps> if a new ver *is* out that fix these, pleas let me know).

peac,
mickei
