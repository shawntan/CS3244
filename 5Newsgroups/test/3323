okai, i got enough repli about the kubota kenai/denali system that i
will post a summari of their capabl.  i haven't actual us on
or seen on, so take the spec with a grain of salt.  i'd like to see
an independ review of on against, sai, an sgi indigo extrem or
someth.

basic, the kenai workstat ar dec alpha axp base workstat that
run osf/1 ( dec's ) and will like run window nt in the futur.  thei ar
binari compat with digit's osf/1 alpha axp implement.  denali
is their graphic subsystem, which is upgrad in the field by
simpli ad "transform engin".

the two main kenai machin ar the 3400 imag and 3d graphic workstat
and the 3500 imag and 3d graphic workstat.

okai, now the real stuff.  the kenai station work with a graphic architectur
known as denali.  the denali come in three model, the e, p, and v.  thei
us a decchip 21064 superscalar risc processor at 150mhz.  their
capabl ar as follow:

as you can see, these ar pretti power workstat, and the best part
is the price.  i would recommend that you call kubota for more inform.
their number is 408-727-8100.  i'm sure thei'll send you an inform you
mai want.  oh, some price:

low-end

kenai 3400, e seri w/ 1 tem and 5 fbm --- 27,795 dollar u.s.
kenai 3500, e seri w/ 1 tem and 5 fbm --- 45,345 dollar u.s.

high-end

kenai 3400, v seri w/ 6 tem and 20 fbm -- 61,795 dollar u.s.
kenai 3500, v seri w/ 6 tem and 20 fbm -- 79,345 dollar u.s.

if someon could post a rel comparis with an indigo extrem or
someth i would appreci it.

hope thi help someon out there,

brian

ps i am not affili with kubota in ani wai.  hell, i thought thei made
tractor or someth. :-)
