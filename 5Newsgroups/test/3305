	anyon who think that tiff is too complex hasn't dealt with
	cgm, asn.1, cda, dca, sgml, or ani on of a number of other
	veri success file format.  peopl seem perfectli capabl
	deal with these other.  deal with the format of tiff
	is frankli less difficult than deal with the dct, lzw, and
	fax encod of the imag data.  the major of the librari
	which deal with tiff ar dedic to these other issu rather
	than with simpli decod the tag and paramet.

	perhap peopl ar overwhelm in comparison with some rather
	simplemind format such as gif, pcx, and bmp, but to suggest
	that tiff is so complex as to be doom to failur is ludicr.

	that doesn't mean that gif isn't fine, but don't even thing about
	us it in mani instanc.  gif is veri nice for us in low-end
	photo applic and for screen grab and such, but it would
	never do for high-volum or high-resolut system.  fax is nice,
	but it doesn't do color (and gif doesn't do b&w all that well).
	jpeg is nice for high-resolut color, but is slow for low-end.

	the advantag tiff bring to the tabl is it abil to handl
	all these situat (and then some).  natur it's more complex.
	but i'ld rather propos tiff imag solut over imag
	system base on have to deal with 3-4 file format anydai.

	you mai find that tiff is too complic for your person tast
	but pleas don't wrail against it's complex.  the complex
	it contain is requir to provid the function it doe and
	doesn't come close to the complex found in most commerci
	viabl file format.


	if we're in philosoph argument against complex, let's all
	go program in scheme and forth and do imag with run length
	encod.
