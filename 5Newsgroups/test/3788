subject: program to displai .gif file?
line: 17

it seem silli, but while i've locat thing like tgif that can  edit
gif  file, and variou tool to convert to/from gif format, i haven't
been abl to locat a program that just open a window and displai  a
gif file in it.  i've look thru variou faq file, also to no avail.
is there on lurk about in some  archiv?   noth  sophist;
just "show the pretti pictur"?

altern, if i could locat the spec for gif, i don't suppos it
would be too hard to write it myself, but i have no idea where to even
start look for the spec.  (well, actual, i do have an idea - thi
newsgroup.  ;-)

cost $5, would get 5000 mile to the gallon, and at random time would
explod, kill all it passeng.
