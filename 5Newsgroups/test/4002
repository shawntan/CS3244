i went out and bought the pa16 yesterdai, and instal it into my gatewai
dx2-66v. i follow the instruct and set the sb side with dma 1 and irq5
(the default) and then the pa side with dma 5 and irq 10. my question is how
should i configur for mpu-401 compat. the manual and instal
program recommend irq2, but on my machin it is configur to [cascad] to
irq8-15. so can i still us irq2, or should i choos a differ on? right now
i have the mpu-401 emul mode turn off. actual what is thi "cascad to
irq8-15" busi?  

a relat question (to other gw or vl-bu machin owner) i wa told that 
onli dma 5, 6, 7 ar 16 bit dma, and 0-4 ar 8 bit dma. now what about
32-bit vl-bu master dma?? which dma channel(s) is us by the vl-bu
extens to do 32-bit dma?

yet anoth question, after instal pa16, my link (golf game) will hang
the machin when i select sb mode and run, but work with adlib mode??
civil howev work fine ( at least so far). ani bodi know what i might
have done wrong? 

thank (i am obvious a newbi) -- john
