summari: result of iisi clock modif poll
keyword: iisi,clock,poll

thi poll wa conduct to help user decid whether or not to alter their
iisi clock oscil. i have attempt to gather as mani case histori as
possibl to find some estim of success and risk. the number of repli
probabl show how rare thi modif is but give the impress that
success rate mai be higher than the previou 80% estim. 24 of 24
machin were abl to run at 25 mhz when no add on board were present.
thi is not a scientif survei but it is the best we have to work with.

thank to all who contribut to thi poll. 


issu:

	speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appear to be the norm for machin without
		add on card. all report machin were abl to us
		25 mhz as long as no add on card were present. sever appl
		nubu card were in us. no machin with the nubu adapt
		wa abl to go faster than 25 mhz. on wasn't even abl to
		achiev 25 mhz with the nubu adapt in place
	
		at speed of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distort and
		hi densiti floppi disk problem have been report.
		
		note: unless specif list below, machin were not
			test with a higher speed clock to failur. henc,
			the 25 mhz oper machin mai well work at
			higher speed.
			
	damag) on user report pull out the plate of on pad. thi wa
		repair and the machin is oper. on other
		report pull the pin out of the origin clock oscil
		dure desold. there is on second hand report of a user
		put a gash in the motherboard with a slip solder iron.
		
		no report of static discharg damag.
		
		no report of high speed oper caus damag.
		
		then again, i also don't have ani report from user of
		defect parachut.
		
	add on board) compat appear to be a problem with appl nubu
		adapt. sever other add on board have been us with
		success. see case histori
		
	heat sink) virtual all modifi machin had a heat sink instal.
		these were often the to-220 style power transistor type. some
		us epoxi. some us a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacryl glue. there wa also us of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.
		
		
		
case histori:	

all speed ar the effect cpu speed (1/2 of clock oscil). all report
cpu version were 20 mhz.

1)  27.5 mhz oper. ran for 10 minut at 31 mhz befor crash.
    no fpu or other add on card
    heatsink cpu onli
    on 24 hour/dai
    no damag dure instal
   
2)  27.5 mhz oper without appl nubu adapt. 25 mhz top speed with
	appl nubu card instal
    heatsink cpu onli
    on 24 hour/dai
    no floppi problem
    no damag dure instal
   
3)  27.5 mhz oper. unabl to boot at 31 mhz
    heatsink cpu onli
    no floppi problem
    no damag dure instal
   
4)  25 mhz oper
    work with the follow two configur
	
	  	a)	realtech fpu adaptor card
			realtech cach card
			supermac 8*24 pdqsi
		
		b)  	supermac fpu adaptor card
			supermac video spigot
			supermac 8*24 pdqsi
			
5)	33 mhz oper
		fuzzi startup sound
		problem with hi densiti disk

6)	33 mhz oper
		fuzzi startup sound
	heat sink on cpu and chip to right of cpu
	
7)	25 mhz oper. occasion crash at 33 mhz

8)	25 mhz oper.
	us fpu rate at 16 mhz without difficulti
	
9)	25 mhz oper.
	pd adapt with a spectrum 24pdqsi graphic card and a 
	videospigot, a 20mhz fpu
	heat sink on cpu
	
10)	25 mhz oper. 33 mhz fail after sever hour.

11)	25 mhz oper
	 5/80+quicksilv/fpu(onli upgrad)
	 
12)	25 mhz oper. tri 33 mhz - system won't start. 
 	heat sink on cpu
	configur with
		realtech fpu/adapt card
		supermac 8*24 pdqsi
		realtech cach.
	cpu on continu - no problem.
 	floppi work fine at 1.4mb @ 25 mhz
	
13) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	
14) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	
15) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	
16) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	
17) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	on 17-19 hour per dai
	
18) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu + cool fan
	no floppi problem at 25 mhz
	
19) 20 mhz oper. bomb soon after startup at 25 mhz with nubu adapt
	20 mhz rate cpu
	ram 70 ns in slot, 80 on motherboard
	
20) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink ad to cpu later. no damag while unheatsink.
	appl nubu adapt with fpu instal.
	
21) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	
22) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	
23) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
	
24) 25 mhz oper
	heat sink on cpu
