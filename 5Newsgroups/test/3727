hi folk,

i'm try to compil xfig 2.1.7 on a ss1+ run suno 4.1.1 and ow 2.0,
and i'm have a littl troubl with make/imak.  specif, make bomb
when it need to us ani xaw file.  thi isn't surpris sinc x11 file
on sun with the standard ow 2.0 distribut ar in variou place under
/usr/openwin (xaw file ar in /usr/openwin/share/includ/x11/xaw !!)
actual, the real problem is that i know squat about imak, and i don't
know how to tell imak where the x11 file ar.  i can see from the 
makefil that it's look in the wrong place, but the first line of the 
makefil read 

   # makefil gener by imak - do not edit!

help!  is there some wai i can edit the imakefil to tell it where to
look?  (i have set defin = -dopenwin_bug, as it said to in the readm
file.)

email and post ar both fine.

thank in advanc,

dave
