actual, iff is a *format standard*.  it is not a pictur file format, sound
file format, but there exist sever format that us the iff standard.  the
iff pictur standard us by mostli everybodi is a form ilbm (or just ilbm).
the onli 3d iff specif i know of is tddd, which is us by imagin and
it's predecessor, turbo silver.   it is possibl that some of the other amiga
packag us anoth *iff* spec, but i don't know of ani.  lightwav will load
tddd form's i believ.
