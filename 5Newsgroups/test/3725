ok, i'm be driven batti.


try to creat popup-menu (ie. button3 press, and a menu
appear).  i would realli like to us the standard athena
class to achiev thi goal, but for my best attempt
i cannot get the menu to come up without us a menubutton
as the parent of the widget tree.  i know thi should be
possibl to to with an xtpopupspringload() and a
littl twiddl, but someth is escap me.
