for sale:

at&t dataport intern 14.4k fax/modem

the modem is an intern at/(e)isa 8-bit card (just a littl longer
than a half-card).  it ha v.32bi for 14.4kbp data / 9600 bp fax,
v.42, v.42bi, and mnp5 for error-correct and data compress, so
you can get error-free link up to 57,600 bp on a convent phone
line.  thei will "fall back" to ani speed (down to 1200bp) and even
disabl compress and error-correct if necessari in order to
connect with slower and older modem.

it ha a 16550 buffer uart for better compat with
multi-task oper system (window, os/2, unix, etc).

thei us a patent technolog call optic line interfac (oli)
which reduc nois gener by the modem to assur the fastest and
cleanest connect possibl.

these modem come with a lifetim warranti and free lifetim tech
support (and the call is free, too) from at&t.

thei also includ the love and talent quicklink ii for do and the
new quicklink ii for window commun and fax softwar which
will let you conveni sent fax from ani do or window
applic just by print.  the window version will send fax of
ani font and can includ graphic, etc.  the do version can fax
graphic and a limit set of font (i believ that there ar 5 or so,
as well as ani hp laser ii resid font).

i'm ask $210.00 for thi modem (plu utah tax).  thi is at or
below the price of ani other (reput) manufactur of an
equival modem (includ zoom, us robot, etc).  and, it is
back by a compani that will never go awai.

thi price will includ deliveri if you live within 20 mile of
downtown slc.  i can also arrang ship, or you can stop by my home
to pick it up.  (if you're concern about instal an intern
modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrang for includ
instal.)

if you're interest, pleas let me know.  thi is an excel modem
at an excel price (thei normal list for ~$500 and retail for
about ~$300).  i instal on of these last week and it is veri nice.

if you have question about thi, at&t ha an info number at 
(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and i will attemp to answer them.

the modem will go to the highest bidder i get within the next week.

thank.
