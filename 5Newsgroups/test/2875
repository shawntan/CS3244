for bitmap file bigger than about 512k (slightli less sometim depend 
on the exact dimens), the wallpap displai is badli corrupt.  the 
rest of the desktop is fine.  for wallpap bitmap smaller than thi, i 
have no problem.  i have a friend who ha an 800k bitmap which he ha no 
problem with, so it is possibl.  it is also possibl to displai these
bitmap us cshow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video 
card is not at fault.
