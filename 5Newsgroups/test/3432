"some" of the featur:

*  bevel text
*  timelin base anim sequenc
*  realtim bound box preview
*  object link
*  phong shade
*  rai trace
*  bound box shade
*  wirefram shade
*  ghourad shade
*  flat shade
*  anti-alias (none, low, medium, high)
*  environ map
*  quicktim support (wrap a qt movi around an object)
*  procedur surfac
*  compos surfac (for layer surfac)
*  alpha channel support
*  import ep, dxf, and swivel 3d file
*  export dxf and swivel 3d file
*  spline base anim
*  anim assist (for creat smooth movement and other stuff)
*  object morph (surfac and bevel morph too)
