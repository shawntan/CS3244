buslog just announc the bt445 fast scsi-2 vlb interfac as of
april 20.  thi alwai happen to me!

i have a on week old bt545s which is the isa version.  i am
enjoi spectacular perform with a micropoli mc2105 560mb 10ms
3.5" hh 5200 rpm drive.  i'll be chang to the bt445 veri soon,
though it is difficult to imagin even higher transfer speed with
the 32bit vesa support.

you can call buslog and ask 'em about the nt question. i hear that
the support is excel.   i have not had to call them myself yet.
