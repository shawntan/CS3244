veri well inde.  at home (a vl bu version of the graphic pro) i can stretch
an avi window to 640x480 and it will continu to plai back smoothli.  it drop
a few more frame but on most machin even attempt such a thing would mean
on frame updat everi 30 second.  an isa graphic+ wa abl to do "zoom by
2" without ani percept perform penalti.  it is the best perform
i've seen so far with the possibl except of an intel indeo board (which
us overlai so it doesn't have to move the decompress data over the isa
bu at ani point).
