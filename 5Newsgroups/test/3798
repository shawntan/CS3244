i've built xcoral on my system (suno 4.1.3, x11r5, motif 1.2, ow 3.0)
and it build fine, but when i run it, ani child window that xcoral
open,
1) lock the mous into the window area
2) doesn't accept ani input from the mous.

needless to sai, thi is a pain in the ass, as i have to go find an
empti termin to login and kill xcoral.

is thi a problem with openwindow or motif?  is there a patch?
