    the irq and interfac-select jumper ar pretti straightforward, but i
    don't grok the set of w10-w18 (also label a15 through a18).
    could somebodi tell me which set of these four jumper correspond
    to what i/o address?
    
the u-b pcnic (also oem by ibm for a while) is the onli ethernet card i
know of that doesn't us i/o address.  it onli ha interrupt and share
memori.  the jumper you see control bit 15-18 in the base address of the
share memori.  i can't recal which is 1 and which 0, but that's easi
to determin with debug.
