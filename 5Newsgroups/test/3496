      i wa skim through a few gopher and bump into on at nih
   with a databas that includ imag in .gif format.  while i have
   not yet work out the kink of get the gopher client to call
   an x viewer, i figur that the major of the user here ar not
   in an x11 environ - instead us do and ms-kermit.

      with kermit support tek4010 emul for graphic displai,
   doe anyon know of a packag that would allow a tek to displai a
   .gif imag?  it would be of more us to the local popul to
   plug someth of thi sort in as the 'pictur' command instead of
   xview or xloadimag ...
