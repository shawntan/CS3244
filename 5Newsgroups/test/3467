mayb. i've had an epson portabl with backlit lcd sinc 1988 which is
still us daili and the screen on that is fine. the onli problem it
ha (and ever ha had) is the "arm" of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairli harshli the screen goe off until you wiggl it
round a bit. but other than that, it's been perfect! so what's that,
about um, 60 month???!
