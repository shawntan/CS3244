hi all,

i've heard of a commerci packag name zink, that could convert ms-window
sourc-code to xwindow sourc-code (c). the onli problem is, the packag
isn't avail in holland (at least, i can't find it anywher :-( )

is there anoth packag (preferr free- or sharewar), that can do the 
same thing? and if so, where can i find or bui it?

thank in advanc
