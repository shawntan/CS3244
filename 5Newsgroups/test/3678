frequent-ask question about the open look graphic user interfac.

if your question isn't here, pleas try (at *least*)
	man openwin
	man xnew
	man 7 xview
and look in the appropri manual list in the bibliographi below
befor post to the comp.window.open-look, comp.window.x or
alt.toolkit.xview newsgroup and/or their correspond mail list.

special note:
    * i have not updat thi faq for the recent-announc openwindow 4,
      due to ship later thi year.
    * ye, sun is move to motif, along with all of cose.  but the motif to
      which thei move will be a new motif, with some of the open look ui
      featur ad.
    * ye, openwindow 4 will us dp instead of new.  new is dead.
      thi mean tnt is dead, too.
    * xview and olit will be support, but probabl not enhanc after the
      next releas.  i don't know if there will be a sourc releas of
      xview 3.1 or not.
    * the cose environ will includ at least some of sun's deskset,
      port to motif.  look for calendar manag and mailtool, at least.
    * ye, the new mailtool will be mime-compliant.

@ what is open look?
    open look is a specif of a graphic user interfac (gui).
    a gui determin the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of
    window, button and scroll-bar, how you resiz thing, how you
    edit file, etc.

    the open look gui is specifi, develop and maintain jointli by
    sun microsystem and at&t (or usl?).

    see also:
	bibliographi

@ what is openwindow?
    openwindow is a window environ that conform to the open look
    graphic user interfac specif.  it's compat with the
    x11 window system from mit as well as (current) sun's new and sunview,
    so you can intermix program written for ani of those system.
    it come from sun and also with system v releas 4 from certain vendor.
    openwindow is sometim also call openwin or xnew, after the
    program us to start it and the main execut itself, respect.
    it should not be call `window' or 'open look' or `openlook', as
    these term ar either wrong or appli to someth els.
    a commer openwindow sourc licenc cost about $5,000 for the server,
    plu about $25,000 for deskset, and anoth $40,000 for tooltalk.
    the current version of openwindow for variou platform ar:
	suno 4.1.1 on sun 3: 2.0
	solari 1.x (suno 4.1.x) on sparc: 3.0
	solari 2.0 (suno 5) on sparc: 3.0.1

    see also:
	mix x11 and openwindow
	where can i get it?

@ what ar olit, xview and tnt?
    these ar all toolkit for programm to us in develop program
    that conform to the open look specif.  see the bibliographi
    for document on the individu toolkit.  here's a brief summari:

    olit wa at&t's open look intrins toolkit for the x window system;
    it us a widget set, and wa probabl the easiest for peopl who were
    alreadi x11/xt programm to learn.  you could bui the sourc from at&t,
    although you didn't get the same version tht sun ship.  sun includ the
    olit librari in openwindow (q.v.); it is also often includ in
    system v releas 4.  it wa written in c.  the releas of olit in
    openwindow 3.0 wa olit 3.0.  olit support pass to usl (then a
    divis of at&t, now own by novel), who replac it with moolit (q.v.).
    note that becaus of the natur of xt subclass, you will probabl
    want or need olit sourc in order to develop a larg applic or
    anyth els that us subclass.
    [see the proceed of the 1991 x technic confer]

    xview is sun's toolkit for x11, written in c.  xview is similar in
    programm interfac to sunview.  there's even a shell script to help
    migrat sourc code from sunview to xview.	 xview is often said to be
    the easiest toolkit to learn if you ar not familiar with x window.
    the xview toolkit is includ in openwindow, and full sourc is
    avail by anonym ftp from export.lc.mit.edu (and elsewher).
    the current version of xview from sun is 3.0.
    despit rumour to the contrari -- some even from within sun -- the
    xview toolkit is *not* about to be drop by sun.  xview *will* be
    includ in the next releas of openwindow, unlik new.
    on the other hand, the xview toolkit is not like to receiv as much
    attent from sun in the futur as olit.

    the new toolkit (tnt) wa an object-orient program system base
    on the postscript languag and new.  tnt implement mani of the
    open look interfac compon requir to build the user interfac of
    an applic.  it's current includ in openwindow.

    the current version of tnt from sun is 3.1; releas 3 contain some
    incompat with `tnt' 1.0 and tnt 2.0, but sun ar commit to
    support the api, at least until thei stop new support some time
    later thi year and replac it with displai postscript.  wail.
    you might ask what `is commit to' mean in thi context; the
    answer seem to be that it mean absolut noth.
    sun current assert that it is commit to olit, howev.

    the c++ user interfac toolkit (uit) consist of an object-orient c++
    class librari layer on top of xview and a tool to gener code from
    devguid 3 gil file.  the uit also includ featur that simplifi
    event manag and the us of postscript and color.  it is said to be
    compat with openwindow v2 and v3, and presum v3.0.1, sinc the
    releas mention that it work on solari 2.
    uit is not an offici sun-support product but an ongo project of
    variou peopl within sun.  it can be found on export.lc.mit.edu in
    the mit contrib directori as uitv2.tar.z (us binari mode!).

@ where doe motif fit in?
    it doesn't :-).  motif is an altern graphic user interfac that
    is be develop by osf.	it ha a `look and feel' reminisc of
    microsoft window and the os/2 present manag.  there ar no non-
    commerci motif toolkit avail, although the motif sourc is sold
    reason cheapli by osf.	although motif is current avail on
    more platform than openwindow, the open look gui is almost certainli
    us on mani more machin, simpli becaus sun (and sysvr4) have such a
    larg instal base.
    sun's cd/ware volum 2 contain a roadmap for improv motif
    applic by convert them to olit [:-)]; there ar also note in
    the `period tabl' olit demo, $openwinhom/demo/olitt.

@ what is moolit?
    moolit is a version of olit from at&t/usl that let user choos between
    a motif and an open look ui feel at run-time.  it will be part of system v
    releas 4.2.
    contact: joann newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677

@ what about that displai postscript thing?
    sun and adob have agre that sun will includ the dp extens to x
    in the next releas of openwindow.  dp is essenti a badli design
    hack on top of a slow level 2 postscript interpret intend to give a
    veri small subset of the function of new whilst simultan
    be harder to us, as i understand it.  the onli real advantag it
    ha over new is that the manual is much smaller, be gener less
    complet; dp is also avail on more kind of machin.
    perform on our rs/6000 is not suitabl for interact work;
    what it will be like on the sparcstat remain to be seen.
    note that wherea x/new font ar share by both subsystem, the dp
    extens to x doe _not_ make type 1 postscript font avail to
    ordinari x11 program.  it is not like atm on a pc in thi regard.
    (there is at least on third-parti version which doe make font
    avail, howev)

subject: window manag -- olwm, olvwm

@ what ar olwm and olvwm?
    thei ar window manag.  a window manag is the part of the x window
    system (e.g. x11) that is respons for decid how to lai out window
    on the screen, and for manag the user's interact with the window.

    olwm is the standard open look window manag.
    it's includ with all of the openwindow (q.v.) implement, and
    you can also get the sourc by ftp, sinc sun donat it.

    olvwm is a version of olwm that manag a `virtual desktop' (henc the
    `v' in it name).  it show a littl map on the screen, with the
    current displai area repres by a littl rectangl.	 you can
    move around by drag the rectangl or with the arrow kei.  thi
    let you run sever client (applic) and move the displai around
    from on to the other.  olvwm wa deriv from the openwindow 3.0 olwm
    by scott oak; you need to have xview 3.0 to compil it.
    get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lc.mit.edu (in the contrib
    directori; there ar three patch).

@ can i us my favorit window manag with openwindow instead of olwm?
    ye.  if you us twm, for exampl, or mwm, you won't be abl to us
    the pin and unpin featur of olwm, and you (probabl) won't see the
    footer some window us to displai certain messag.

    if you us twm, you'll want to us the f.delet function to unpin menu
    and get rid of program that don't have a `quit' button when not run
    under olwm.
    for twm, put thi in your $home/.twmrc:
	lefttitlebutton "target" = f.delet
    where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/includ/x11/bitmap.
    altern, try
	# add a menu to each window manag by twm or tvtwm
	lefttitlebutton ":menu" = f.menu "ol.menu"

	menu "ol.menu" {
	    "quit"         f.delet
	}

    for mwm, you can doubl-click on the menu icon on the left of the titl
    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (i am told).

    see the manual page for your window manag (twm, etc).

subject: openwindow, termin, and other displai

@ can i us olwm and olvwm without openwindow or on an x termin?
    the openwindow xnew server combin sunview, new (postscript) and x11.
    thi mean that it can run program compil for ani of those system.
    unfortun, it mean that some openwindow program need either new
    or sunview support, and thu won't run on an x termin.  thi includ
    pageview in particular.

    you can us olwm or olvwm (see abov) on an x termin or a non-open-
    window displai, and most open look client (e.g. olit or xview on)
    will work perfectli well.  you mai find that you get complaint about
    font not be found.  if so, see the font section below.
    if you ar run the window manag built-in to an ncd termin, you
    mai have problem with input focu; set *input: true in the termin's
    xdefault file in /usr/lib/x11/xdm mai or mai not help.


subject: configur file: get start with openwindow
     
@ what configur file do i need to know about?

    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc

    the first time you run openwindow, a .xinitrc file will be creat in
    your login directori ($home).  if it alreadi exist, you might have to
    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and ani other old x11 file
    you have to anoth directori, and then merg the old and new file.

    if your site us xdm, you should us .xsession instead of .xinitrc,
    sinc xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.

    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sy

    these ar option file you can creat in your $home directori,
    depend on which version of olwm or olvwm you us.
    look in $openwinhom/lib (normal /usr/openwin/lib) for these file
    without the lead . and copi ani you want to chang.  you mai need
    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recogn.  if you ar not on an
    x termin, you will want to run a consol window (such as cmdtool -c,
    shelltool -c, xterm -c) or chuck musciano's "contool" program so that
    system output will be direct there instead of write over your screen.
    note that .openwin-sy is not execut unless you edit .xinitrc.

    .xdefault

    you can put x window resourc specif in here.  in particular,
    it is a good idea to includ at least:
	openwindow.focusleni:	true
	*input: true
    these allow non-icccm-compliant program to receiv input even if thei
    forget to ask for it.

    prop, the program that run when you select `properti' from the default
    root menu under olwm or olvwm, write your choic into .xdefault.
    don't put comment in .xdefault, sinc `prop' delet them.

    .startup.ps

    thi is the new user profil file, read by openwindow (actual xnew)
    on startup.	 thi is document in the new program manual, near the
    back.  the most us thing to put here is postscript code to chang
    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be veri care, sinc a
    syntax error in the postscript mean that xnew will either not start up
    at all or will get broken in strang wai.	the new manual give code
    that is both incorrect and insuffici.
    warn: thing in thi file rare work on both openwindow 2 and 3.

    note that the mous speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see
    the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more inform.

    here's what $home/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delai of
    about a third of a second (300000 microsecond), and a repeat rate of
    twenti or so kei per second (30000 microsecond between repeat) for
    openwindow 3.  you'll have to experi a bit becaus the repeattim
    is the delai between kei sent, and thu doesn't includ the time to
    process each kei, which is probabl higher on my 4/110 than on your
    supersparc 10/51 gti inject :-)  again, thi is for openwindow 3...

	% don't want the demo - see p. xxxii of new toolkit refer manual
	% /includedemo? fals def

	userprofil begin
	    /keyrepeatthresh 0 300000 timev storetimev def
	    /keyrepeattim 0 30000 timev storetimev def
	    % note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatli...
	end

    you must also have a .user.ps file in the same directori, like thi:

	/new 3 0 findpackag beginpackag
	/tntcore 3 0 findpackag beginpackag
	/tnt 3 0 findpackag beginpackag

	classrepeatkei pop	% forc repeat.ps to autoload

	endpackag endpackag endpackag

    if you chang these paramet, you can test them without restart the
    openwindow server like thi:
	$ psh -i .startup.ps
	welcom to x11/new version3
	$ psh -i
	welcom to x11/new version3
	/classinit classrepeatkei send
	%%% now press control-d

    you can also either of these two file (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make
    the root window be "retain", so that a postscript draw on the
    background won't be eras when you move window:
	frambuff /retain true put
    will do thi.  note that thi mai increas the amount of memori us
    by the new server (xnew) dramat.

	environ variabl

@ how can i configur open look for a left-hand mous and keyboard?
    you can us xmodmap to chang the mous button, but be prepar for on
    or two occasion surpris.  see also "man 7 xview" for a list of
    keybind you can chang, at least for xview program.

    with openwindow 2.0, you can us defaultsedit to set the mous map
    and then let sunview handl them.  the statu return by svenv should
    tell you whether your server is run under sunview or not; put thi
    in your .xinitrc:

    if eval `svenv -env`
    then
	xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3"
	input_from_default
    els
	xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"
    fi


@ how can i get the screen to go blank when the system is idl?

    run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a bore but
    effect screen saver.  see `man screenblank'.
    under solari 2 you'll need to copi screenblank from an older system, as
    it's not suppli.  then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system
    run screenblank automat.

subject: kei bind, cut and past

@ how do i cut and past between xterm and openwindow program?

    to go from xterm to textedit (sai):
    * select the text you want to copi by drag the select mous button
      in xterm
    * press copi in the xterm (thi kei is l6, or meta+c (the o'reilli
      xview manual get thi wrong)
    * move to the textedit window, and press past (l8 or meta+v)

    if thi doesn't work, see troubl shoot: cut and past

   to go the other wai, from textedit to xterm:
    * select the text in textedit.  no need to us copi
    * move to the xterm window and press adjust (the middl mous button).
    * you can also us the copi/cut and past button.

@ copi/past is bore.	 what short-cut ar avail?

    quick copi within textedit, mailtool, etc:
    * click select to get a text caret where you want the copi text to go
    * press and hold down the past (or cut) button
    * select the text you want to copi/move.  you'll see that it's underlin
      or cross out, as appropri.  (in the jed demo it goe grei)
    * let go of the past (or cut) button.
    * the text you underlin or cross out appear at the insert caret.

    drag and drop to move a select
    * select the text you want to copi or move, by drag or multipl-
      click the select or adjust mous button
    * put the mous pointer anywher within the select
    * press and hold down down the select mous button, and move the mous
      pointer a littl to the right; you'll see the cursor chang to be the
      first 3 letter of the text (or some other icon).
    * still hold select down, move the mous over the point where you want
      to drop the text
    * you mai see the mous pointer chang to a rifl-sight or target, to show
      that it's ok to drop thing here
    * let go of select, and the text is move.	thi work in text field of
      dialogu box as well as in text subwindow.

    drag and drop to copi a select
    * thi is the same as us drag and drop to move a select, except that
      you must hold the control kei down as well as the select mous button.

@ what ar the default kei bind in textedit and elsewher?

    see the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.
    in gener, the edit/move command go in the opposit direct when
    shift - e.g. ctrl+w delet a word, and ctrl+w delet the word to the
    right of the insert point.

	meta-i - includ file	    meta-f - find select (forward/backward)

	ctrl-a - start of line	    ctrl-< - back word
	ctrl-e - end of line	    ctrl-> - forward word
	ctrl-w - delet word	    ctrl-u - delet to start/end of line
	ctrl-return - move to end/start of document

    see the o'reilli xview refer manual for a list of some of the default
    kei; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.

@ what can i put in my .ttysrc?	 where is it document?

    see the manual page for shelltool.

    troubl shoot: strang error messag, below.

@ how can i arrang to have my .signatur includ in my outgo mail?
    the best wai is:
    $ cd
    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .
    $ chmod +w .textswrc
    edit .textswrc (us vi, textedit, or whatev you prefer)
    add the follw:
	kei_right(3)    filter
	cat ~/.signatur
    (you might need to chang ~ to $home)

    now press r3 will insert your .signatur file.



subject: font

@ doe openwindow support type 1 postscript font?
    ye, under either solari 2.0 or 2.1 (i'm not sure which).
    or, not yet, in other word.

    if you have framemak there is a util to import them, i'm told.
    the 57 font suppli with openwindow ar fulli hint, though, and
    compar them to the microsoft window and appl truetyp font is
    interest...  the f3 font format is describ in a public from the
    sun openfont group, list in the bibliographi below.  document on
    the unbundl version of typescal is also avail from sun openfont.

    you can bui f3 font from sunpic, monotyp, linotyp, urw and probabl
    other major foundri.

    sunpic' newsprint softwar support type 1 font.

@ improv font render time
    although the sun type render (typescal) is pretti fast, it's not as
    fast as load a bitmap :-).  you can pre-gener bitmap font for size
    that you us a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cach
    paramet.	 if you have a lot of memori you might want to increas the
    font cach size.

@ convert between font format (convertfont, etc.)
    you can also us folio font with an x11 server, by convert them to a
    bitmap (x11 bdf format) first.  your licenc forbid you from us the
    font on anoth machin, and unless you have newsprint you shouldn't
    us them for print.  have said all that...  you can us makeafb and
    convertfont to gener bdf file that you can compil with bdftosnf or
    bdftopcf.

    us mftobdf (from the seetex distribut) to convert tex pk font to
    x11 bdf format, which you can then us with either x11 or oenwindow.

    you can also us der mous's "getbdf" to get bdf font from a run
    x displai server -- ftp: larri.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /x/getbdf

@ xview/olit font at 100 dpi
    there aren't ani.  more precis, the variou text font, such as
    lucida typewrit san, ar avail at 100 dpi, and in fact ar
    scalabl under openwindow.	 the glyph font ar bitmap, and don't
    scale veri well.

    the sunview program ar still around in /usr/bin, and have name
    that ar the same as their openwindow counterpart.  you almost
    certainli want to run the program in $openwinhom instead.

    set your path so that $openwinhom/bin (and $openwin/bin/xview for
    openwindow 2) come befor /bin (or /usr/bin, thei're the same), or

subject: troubl shoot: it won't let me type

@ when i try to type into some program, i just get beep or noth happen
    it is a good idea to includ at least:
	openwindow.focusleni:	true
	*input: true
    in your .xdefault file, as these allow non-icccm-compliant program to
    receiv input even if thei forget to ask for it.
    see the next item for edit .xdefault

subject: troubl shoot: cut and past not work

@ i can't past from xterm to xview (includ sun deskset) program
    under openwindow 2, you need to add the follow either to your
    $home/.xdefault file, or to $openwinhom/lib/app-default/xterm instead:

	xterm*vt100.translat: #overrid \
		<kei>l6:select-set(clipboard)\n\
		<kei>l8:insert-select(clipboard)
  
    you must not move the mous between end the select and press
    l8 (the past kei)!

    under openwindow 3, thi is alreadi in the app-default file, so if it
    isn't work, check that xfilesearchpath is set to
	/usr/openwin/lib/%t/%n%s
    and if it isn't, either set it or copi/merg the abov line from
    $openwinhom/lib/app-default/xterm into /usr/lib/x11/app-default/xterm.
    [see also: environ variabl]

    thi version automat put each xterm select onto the clipboard:
	xterm*vt100.translat: #overrid\n\
	    ~ctrl ~meta<btn2up>: insert-select(primari,cut_buffer0)\n\
	    ~ctrl ~meta<btnup>: select-end(primari,cut_buffer0,clipboard)\n\
	    <keypress>l8: insert-select(clipboard)
    [note: be sure that the \n\ is at the veri end of the line, there must
     be no follow space, and ani + or | sign show that thi faq file
     wa alter must also be remov!]

    if you ar us x11r5, you mai find that ad the line
<kei>l10: start-extend() select-end(primari, clipboard, cut_buffer0)\n\
       <keyreleas>l10: kill-select() \n
    befor the <keypress>l8 line will make l10 (cut) work as a cut kei!

    if you alter $home/.xdefault instead, you must us what x call a
    `more specif' resourc name:
	xterm.vt100.translat
    will do.

@ i can't past from xview (includ sun deskset) program to xterm

    if you don't have the sun l kei on the left of your keyboard, you can
    us meta-x, meta-c and meta-v for cut, coi and past respect.
    you can chang the kei by ad the follow two line to
    your .xdefault file, edit as you wish (the valu shown here ar the
    default):

	openwindow.keyboardcommand.copi: c+meta,l6
	openwindow.keyboardcommand.past", "v+meta,l8
    
    list of resourc ar in the manual page for xview, and also in the
    thinnish blue book `companion to volum 7, xview refer manual' from
    o'reilli, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual page.

@ i alwai get the same piec of text when i press past (l8, meta+v)
    remov the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that help; see also the
    next item.

@ cut copi and past don't work at all (openwindow onli)
    oh dear.  us ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is run
    and that either you or root start it, depend on whether you start
    openwindow with "openwin" or by log in through xdm.
    if not, start it.  if it di, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc
    befor restart it - you mai need to be root to remov it, or you can
    reboot your workstat.
    check that there is space in /tmp (us "df /tmp"), and also see if there
    ar a lot of file there with name like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there ar
    sever hundr of them, cut and past mai take so long that it time out.

    quit ani deskset tool such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start
    a termin emul and remov and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/text* file
    that ar still there.  it's simplest to quit openwin and start it again
    after do that, if cut and past wa broken, but if it start work
    again you can just carri on.  note that file in /tmp not own by you
    might be in us by anoth worker comrad, so don't remov those without
    check first!

subject: troubl shoot: not author to us displai

    if you get error messag that look like

	xlib:  intern error dure connect author check
	error: can't open displai
    try, on the machin run openwindow or x11,
	xhost +machin
    where "machin" is the comput on which you ran the command that fail.
    if you want to let other user run program on the same machin as you,
    us your displai, you will have to type the bizarr-look
	xhost +`hostnam`
    (or xhost +happyboi, if happyboi is the name of your workstat).
    thi let ani user on `happyboi' access your displai.

    with openwindow 3.0 you can also us xauth, and the programm's guid 
    describ how to do thi in chapter 8, p. 101.  thi is more secur.
    also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other user access the
    framebuff directli!

    also note that there is a sun patch for openwindow 3.0 under suno 4.1.1
    to fix a seriou secur problem.  it is avail through your local
    sun answer center as well as through anonym ftp from ftp.uu.net
    [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist:

    on an x termin, there mai be a setup menu that let you chang or
    disabl the list of host that can access the displai.

    if you start get thi messag after you've been log in overnight,
    there might be a cron job that's remov the unix socket in /tmp
    that ar us to commun with the server when $displai doesn't have
    a hostnam befor the :, or is empti.  have the system administr
    chang the cron script to skip socket.

subject: troubl shoot: other common problem

@ i get consol error messag on my screen and thei don't go awai (sun 3 or 4)
    if "refresh" make the messag vanish, but new on come along later,
	you need to run "xterm -c" from your .xinitrc, or start on up in
	the background and then  choos save workspac from the
	workspac->util menu.  better still, pick up "contool" and run
	that.  get it from export.lc.mit.edu in the contrib directori.  it
	will monitor the consol and open, flash it icon or beep when a
	messag appear; it's veri easi to configur.

    if "refresh" from the workspac->util menu doesn't make the messag,
    go awai...
	a sun with a cg4 frame buffer ha two screen - you can move the
	mous off the right-hand (by default) edg of the screen and onto
	a whole new (but monochrom) displai, call ":0.1".  see the man.
	page for openwin; i have a shell script that check for thi and,
	if there's a /dev/cgfour0, doe
		openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0
	if you ar run x11 or openwindow 2, you might need to add thi
	to your .xinitrc or other startup file:
	(
	    eval `svenv -displai unix:0.1 -env`
	    olvwm -displai unix:0.1
	) &
	later releas of olwm and olvwm do thi automat.
	you can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messag.  also, see
	the note about contool, abov.

@ is there an easi wai of edit .xdefault?
    us `prop', which appear in the default root menu as `properti'.
    thi start `prop', a properti editor which will re-write your
    .xdefault after remov comment.  it then appli ani chang.
    keep comment by us "comment." instead of "!", for exampl,
	comment.*.font: palatino-ital-37

@ how do i get the file manag to us emac instead of textedit?
    set the default editor to
	sh -c "exec emac -font lucidasanstypewrit-18 \"$file\""
    (you can chang the font if you prefer a smaller on)

@ how do i run openwindow in invers video?
    thi tend not to work under openwindow 2.	 with opwnwindow 3.0,
    there ar variou wai, includ us -bg and -fg option.  if you're
    us openwindow 2 on a sun 3 , probabl the best you can do (short of
    upgrad the workstat to a sparc!) is to us xterm instead of cmdtool.

@ why don't flat check-box work?
    a known bug mai make guid's output dump core if you us these.
    a workaround is to edit the guid output, as it's onli guid's output
    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.
    thi appli onli to version of devguid befor devguid 3.0.  if you're
    still us an ancient devguid, you should upgrad as soon as possibl;
    the new on is fantast!

@ when i leav openwindow, my screen goe blank or my mous cursor stai
  on the screen.
    try run clear_colormap; if thi help, put it as the last line in
    the shell script you us to start openwindow (e.g. `openwin').

@ when i us snapshot, the system crash, or the server hang, or someth.
    thi wa a bug relat to some system onli.  the onli work-round wa to
    us some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.
    
@ why have some of my function kei stop work?
    kei f11 and f12 chang from sunf36 and sunf37 to sunxk_f36 and sunxk_f37
    respect in openwindow 3.  applic must be recompil, or you
    might be abl to us xmodmap or the public domain xkeycap program to
    chang your keyboard layout back again.

@ when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, i get the sunview version
    see under "troubl shoot: strang error messag" below.

    (see also next item)

@ mix x11 and openwindow
    (see also next item)

    note that openwindow 3.0 includ the x11r4 core distribut (to patch
    level 18), but not the contrib directori.  these note appli to
    openwindow 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with
    openwindow 3.0 and x11r5.

    instal the x11 librari in /usr/lib/x11.	you can intermix openwindow
    and x11r4 or x11r5, thei're all compat in thi respect.
    put the x11 binari in (for exampl) /usr/bin/x11.

    put /usr/bin/x11 last in your path, so that you get openwindow version
    of program instead of x11 on where appropri, although thi is a
    matter of prefer.  in ani event, put the openwindow bin directori
    first -- see the preced item for more detail on that.  if you have
    /bin (or /usr/bin, thei're the same directori on suno) earlier in
    your path than $openwinhom/bin/xview, you'll get sunview program instead
    of openwindow on!

    set ld_librari_path so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the x11
    librari directori.	thi doesn't matter with openwindow 3.0, but with
    older version you'll get error messag from x11 program if you don't
    do thi.  the messag ar gener harmless (see next item), although
    xdm core dump if thi isn't right.

    set openwinhom to the directori contain openwindow if it isn't
    /usr/openwin.

    see also:
	environ variabl (especi xfilesearchpath).

@ i get error messag on my screen about ld.so: libx11.so.4 not found
    set ld_librari_path to be /usr/openwin.  if you also us x11, us
	     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib
    if you put thi in a shell script or your .profil, us
    ${openwinhom-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; thi is for
    /bin/sh; for csh it is differ.

@ i launch my filemgr and i get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero
    your system need to be patch.  look in $openwinhom/lib/ospatch
    and instal the patch.

@ why doesn't answerbook run for me?
    you must be run openwindow to us answerbook.	it won't run under
    x11 (on an x termin or on anyth els) becaus it us new to draw
    the postscript text and pictur.
    if you ar us openwindow 3.0, you need to us the openwindow 3.0
    compat navig; it's call .navig.ow3 on the answerbook cd/rom.
    if all answerbook user ar us openwindow 3.0, you can replac
    navig wih .navig.ow3 altogeth (renam the old on first to
    satisfi your sens of paranoia!)
    the navig.ow3 binari is also on cd/ware vol 2.
    note that the data file ar in postscript, so you can look at them with
    a postsript viewer (q.v.).

@ why aren't there ani fish in realxfishdb?
    a fix version of realxfishdb is avail by ftp from
    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.z

@ why is the properti choic disabl in the window menu?
    it isn't implement yet.  mani program do respond to the properti
    kei (l3), though, or have a pop-up menu with properti on it.

@ file complet in the c-shell is broken in cmdtool
    sadli true, but us shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  it also
    work if you run command tool on a remot machin.
    fix in openwindow 3.0.1 ship with solari 2.

@ when i run olit program, some of the widget ar red!
    releas 3 of olit ad mouseless oper; action widget can be
    select via the keyboard.  the current select item is highlight
    in red (the `red stain') to show that it ha the input focu.
    to disabl it in most place, add thi to your $home/.xdefault file:
	*traversalon: off
	*textedit.traversalon: on
	*textfield.traversalon: on
    you can chang the color us (for exampl)
	*inputfocuscolor: grei50
	*input*focuscolor: green
	*list*inputfocuscolor: <your background color>
    see the man page resourc(3w), at the start of the olit 3 widget set
    refer manual includ in the openwindow 3 programm document.
    meanwhil contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the
    olit/3.0 cte jumbo patch.

@ when i run sever program, the color on the screen all chang when
  i move into a differ window! ("colormap flash")
    
    thi is becasu most hardwar can onli displai a few color at a time.
    howev, you can minimis the effect with the follow procedur:
    *  start all the applic with color that you wish to reserv.
    *  run
	cmap_compact save
       to creat the .owcolor file
    *  put the line
	cmap_compact init
       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)
    *  exit and then restart the window system.
    *  cmap_compact init will push those color .owcolor to the end of
	the colormap and reserv them.

    also note that control-l2 lock the color of the current window, and
    control-l4 unlock them -- thi is describ in the olwm manual page.

@ pageiew us the wrong color, or make the colormap flash (see abov):
    thi problem wa report by peopl for some reason run the motif
    window manag (mwm) with openwindow.
    try run pageview like thi:
	$openwinhom/bin/reservecolor -svmono
	$openwinhom/bin/pageview
	$openwinhom/bin/reservecolor -discard

@ xdm break thing
    command tool doesn't like be run without a unix `control termin'.
    us /etc/setsid to start your command tool and all will be well.
    sunview applic mai need to be run with svenv, as in
	svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic
    becaus xdm won't set the necessari environ variabl.
    note that the mit xdm start up the x server as root, which is a secur
    hole for openwindow; us the openwindow 3.0 xdm or be awar that your
    user can access file and start unix process ass root...

@ function kei 11 and 12 stop work
    in openwindow 3.0, the x11 name ("keysym") for these kei wa chang
    to sunxk_f36 and sunxk_f37.	 code which us them should be recompil,
    or you might be abl to get awai with
	xmodmap -e 'keysym sunxk_f36 = sunf36'

subject: troubl shoot: xview problem
    thi section is here onli until an xview faq appear, which ha been
    promis, but hasn't reach here.	note that there is also a usenet
    newsgroup, alt.toolkit.xview, although it doesn't sem to have veri
    wide distribut and ha triffic of the order of on or two articl
    per month.	you should also look at the faq in comp.window.x.

@ how do i set the font of individu scroll list item?
    panel_list_font take an int row_number and an xv_opaqu font_handl.
    panel_list_font take a null termin list of xv_opaqu font_handl.
    there is no easi wai to make an entir list fix width font.
    you have to make sure that you alwai specifi panel_list_font when you
    insert a new row into that list, or write a conveni function
    insert_row(list, row, string) that hide the nasti bit.

@ how do i keep an xview pop-up window displai after a button is press?
    in the button callback, do
        xv_set(button, panel_notifi_statu, xv_error, null);
    thi will keep the window visibl.
    you might also need to investig the menu_notifi_statu attribut.

@ how do i make an xview button look press?
    call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these ar
    document in -- er -- the xview 3 sourc...

    mark, and i've ad some comment for user of x11r4 and x11r5, too.

    displai  the name of the x window displai to us
	:0.0 (on the local machin, the on actual run x11 or xnew)
	:0.1 (on some machin for a second, monochrom screen)
	machin-run-unix:0.0 (on other machin)
	(you mai need to do "xhost +other-machin" to let program on other
	machin us your displai; see also under troubl shoot, and see
	the section on xauth in the openwindow version 3 programm's guid,
	pp. 101ff)
	see also: consol messag, under troubl shoot
    fontpath  where xnew search for font
	/usr/openwin/lib/font
	(you can also us "xset fp+ dir" to add a directori to the font path,
	but you mai have to do "xset fp rehash" afterward.  thi is fine
	under openwindow, but mani x11 server have font problem)
    helppath  where xview look when you press the help kei (or f1)
	/usr/openwin/lib/local:/usr/openwin/lib/help
	(on suno 4.0.*, or with openwindow 2.0, omit the first entri, which
	is for site us a local other than "c" or "usa").
    ld_librari_path   where to look to find share c librari
	/usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/cc/`arch`
	(the /usr/cc/`arch`/lib entri is onli need if you us c++ program)
    openwinhom	 where openwindow live
	/usr/openwin  
    keyboard, mous -- serial devic to us instead of the consol
	(don't set these for normal us; /dev/kbd and /dev/mous)
    path  where the shell search for program to run
	$(openwinhom)/bin:$(openwinhom)/bin/xview:/usr/local/bin:.\
	$home/bin.`arch`:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/x11:/usr/host:\
	(you will certainli want to chang thi exampl!  there is no
	$(openwinhom)/bin/xview in openwindow 3.0)
    xfilesearchpath  where program look for app-default file
	/usr/openwin/lib/%t/%n%s
        (thi is set automat by "openwin" in openwindow 3.0)
        you might want to us /usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%s, or perhap both,
        separ with a :, for exampl (for sh user)
            xfilesearchpath=$openwinhom/lib/%t/%n%s:/usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%s
	    export xfilesearchpath
	if you us x11r5, you might instead want
	    /usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c%s:
	    /usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%c%s:
	    /usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%c%s:
	    /usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%s:
	    /usr/lib/x11/%l/%t/%n%s:
	    /usr/lib/x11/%t/%n%s:
	    $openwinhom/lib/%t/%n%s
	(put all thi on on line, though, with no space!)

	togeth with the follow in lib/xinitrc
	xrdb -merg <<'end_xrdb'
	   *custom:
	end_xrdb

	xrdb -merg <<'end_xrdb'
	#ifdef color
	   *custom:  -color
	#endif
	end_xrdb

	you automat get a color oclock, editr, bitmap, xcalc, and
	xlogo sinc thei us the "*custom" resourc appear as %c in
	the xfilesearchpath. (see oclock (n))
	accord to rainer sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>.
