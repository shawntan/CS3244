i have a sparc-2 with 2 cgsix card in it.  i'd like
to have the r5 server recogn the second card.


i mknod creat a /dev/cgsix1 devic, but when i brought up the
server, the second devic wa ignor.  

how do i setup the second card?


note:  if i borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and
a cgsix card in the same sparc-2 box, the r5 server find
the second card. i then set the displai to the
second card, and start a second window manag.  

wors case is i trade card with someon, but mayb someon
out there ha seen thi problem alreadi...
