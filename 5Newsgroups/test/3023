even better than that...  how doe a 68000-base amiga 2000 perform in 
daili task compar to my 68030-base iici.

answer, except in a veri few case, i get my butt kick by the amiga.
sure there ar other consider, but it goe to show you how
proper design from the begin (in hardwar and softwar) can give
you great return.  [as well as show you that if you don't have a 
market depart to speak of, no on will care how good your system is]

i'm still happi with my ci, but i don't understand why the perform is
so bad (compar).  thei could have done multi-task _properli_.
thei could have done everth els better -- but appl didn't.
(of cours do 6 and window 3.1 ar nothin to write home about either!!)

oh well, y'all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02
