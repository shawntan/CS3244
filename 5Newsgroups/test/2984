by night i'm an amiga user. by dai i work with window. i'd be much more 
comfort in window if i had two thing.

1. a good person inform manag. you know- a calendar, address book,
remind list etc... roll into on clean interfac.

2. a good file manag. microsoft is veri poor by my standard. how
about on that ha a left and right window and allow file oper 
between them. be abl to launch program from the same interfac
would be nice. as well as text read and graphic view. those
who ar familiar with directori opu on the amiga know what i'm
look for.

if anyon can steer me toward an ftp sight with these program it would
make my transit to window a lot easier. pleas repli via email
as i rare get to read thi group. thank so much!
