   i wa wonder if anyon know of a graphic packag for the pc that
   will do composit of a seri of pictur?

   what i mean by "composit" is, sai i have a live video clip
   (digit) pan around a live room, and a comput-gener
   bird fly around the screen.  i want to combin these two seri of
   pictur so that everywher where the bird frame ar black, i want
   the live room pictur to show through.  ye, i realiz i can do thi
   with a genlock, and i do own a genlock, but i want to be abl to do
   manual composit also.  it's ok if i have to composit on frame at
   a time; i assum i'd have to do that anywai.  but be abl to
   composit a seri of frame would be even better.

   i've look around and i haven't found a pc packag that will perform
   thi.  help, pleas!

if you can get the live anim and the comput-gener anim
into autodesk anim .fli or .flc format, autodesk anim will do
thi for you.  it can take on anim, make a certain color
"clear", and overlai it over anoth anim.  i do not have a wai
right now to convert .avi or .mpg file to anim file.  anim
will also import a seri of .gif file to creat an anim, so if
your video captur stuff can creat thi is might work.
