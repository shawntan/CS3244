a friend of mine us window 3.1 to do most of her work.
unfortun, she ha veri bad eyesight, and we haven't
been abl to figur out how to chang the default font
us by the system and applic menu, or the font us
by the help program (what us is hypertext if you can't
read it?) to make it legibl to her.

if anyon know how to increas the size of these font,
of ani softwar packag that make window more access
to visual handicap peopl, pleas let me know.

thank,
