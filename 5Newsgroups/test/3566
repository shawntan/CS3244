how can i captur buttonpress/buttonreleas event in multipl client?
i want to know if the user is still at the displai befor lock the screen.
i can get  keypress/keyreleas and pointer motion event, but if the user
is press the mous button in the same locat (the mous doesn't move)
i can't captur the event.  

the o'reilli xlib program manual (vol. 1) sai on page 252;
   "onli on client can select button event on ani on window at on time, 
    due to the grab that automat take place."
