mani thank to those who respond to my question.  unfortun i have
had no luck in actual get such a font, and a lot of peopl interest
in gete on, and so i have decid to creat my own truetyp font fit 
that descript.  thi font is base on that us in the 1904 issu of 
dineen's dictionari and is typic of that found in irish book from the 
earli part of the centuri.  thi mai take me some time to do (in my
limit spare time) but i'll make it avail to anyon who is interest, 
when it is readi.

the respons i receiv ar summeris below:

kevin donnelli (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mention that michael everson
(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had develop some clo/ gaelach font
for the macintosh and mai be abl to advis me.  i contact michael
and he told me that he ha three font avail for the macintosh, and
that he will eventu port them to the pc, but that he will be charg 
ir 100 (about $160) for each on.

pbryant@ukelel.gcr.com mention that he us two font that have a
'nice irish/gaelic look to them'.  these ar "durrow" and "american 
uncial-normal".  i don't know where you can get these but i don't
think that thei have the effect i am look for.

final, rhiannon@netcom.com (rhia) mention that the "meath" font
includ in the casadi & green fluent laser font 2 packag
is veri much like what i wa describ.  i fax casadi & green for
info but got no repli.

so that's it.  i'll post these newsgroup when i make my font avail.

colum twomei.
