i total agre with your friend, sinc when the cpu is appar idl
it is still in fact churn awai million of instruct per second
(check for keyboard input for instanc).  

the except to thi is for cpu's us in laptop, where the cpu can
enter an idl state where it is just preserv it current statu but
do absolut noth.  in thi case it need a hardwar interrupt
to get it go again.
