here is the latest on reloc your help file to a server.  
the winhelp() function, as i am told by ms, doe search your path so 
reloc ms window helpfil won't be a problem as long as you includ
the path to where you move them to, howev, if an applic ha 
hardcod the path into their code so that when winhelp is invok it
search the given path (i.e. winhelp(hwnd, c:\amipro) for exampl) then
winhelp doe not search your path and instead look onli to that directori
where you have instal your softwar.

i test thi out on a varieti of softwar packag.  i move all my 
helpfil to the drive z:\ and includ thi in the path statement.
here is the result for differ softwar packag:


norton desktop			found helpfil
window v3.1 for workgroup	found helpfil
window v3.1			found helpfil
ms powerpoint v3.0		found helpfil
ms word				found helpfil
ms excel v4.0a			did not find helpfil (strang)
ms foxpro v2.5 for window	found helpfil
lotu amipro v3.0		did not find helpfil
procomm plu for window	did not find helpfil


i guess thi is better than noth but it would make sens to be abl to 
specifi a global path for helpfil.  

if anyon ha ani comment or if i can help anyon or if i left someth
out pleas let me know.
