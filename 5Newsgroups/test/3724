i am plan to convert my motif 1.2 app from pixel to font unit
which would all be set in the app's resourc file instead of hard code
in the program.

howev, the word here is from peopl who tri thi alreadi that for
some unknown reason xmform offset place in the resourc file ar still
interpret in pixel unit forc peopl to code those offset font unit into the program.

can somebodi confirm thi?

thank,
