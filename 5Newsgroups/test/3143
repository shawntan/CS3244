 thi is a pet peev of mine. i wish compani would put power switch on the
 front of the equip! if my appl monitor had the switch on the front, i
 would happili power it off at night. almost everi piec of comput equip
 i own/us ha the switch on the back (includ extern hard drive and
 modem--why?). i hope front-mount switch becom the norm, and soon.
