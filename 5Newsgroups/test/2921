i have been us the join command for mani year now, mostli with good
success in duplic unix-style file mount.  you will hear lot of
peopl curs join becaus thei confus it with the do append command
(a trueli gnarli hack), but don't believ them.  you also will hear
peopl sai that microsoft recommend that you not us join.  but, in
microsoft's window 4 workgroup resourc toolkit, the follow appear:

  "join, an ms-do util, work fine with window for workgroup 3.1 if
  you do not chang the state of the join drive dure a window for
  workgroup 3.1 session. thi includ ad or remov join drive
  from within window for workgroup. we recommend that you do not us
  join when run window setup or window for workgroup 3.1."

within thi caveat, join appear to be valid under window.  howev, i
have found a coupl of applic that don't deal well with filesystem
that have been "mount" us join.

in particular, the worst offend is word for window 2.0x.  it get veri
confus when you edit and then try to save a file on a join drive. it
want to creat the save file as ~nnnnn.tmp in the current dir, then
delet the old file and renam the ~nnnnn.tmp file to the *.doc file.

unfortun, wfw usual write the ~nnnnn.tmp file in some idiot
place other than the current directori (often in the root dir of the
join filesystem, but not alwai).  then, after delet the origin
*.doc file, it can't find the ~nnnnn.tmp file to renam it.  unless you
search your disk system, the document is gone.

i have also found subtl problem us the mk toolkit from a do box
when join filesystem ar present.  i us to join c:\temp with a 4meg
ramdisk, but mk sometim get confus when do an "ls" on the c:\temp
dir, and miss some file in the temp dir.  (thi is difficult to 
reproduc, but it goe awai total when join is not us.)  i think
thi is a window problem, rather than mk's, sinc it work ok under raw
do.

so, i would suggest that you can us join, but be awar that it mai not
be as robust you would like.

wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drive (i.e. z:) under the main
file tree, rather than have all those darn drive letter? unfortun,
join won't let you do it.  there wa talk on the net about a simpl patch
to let join work on network drive, but i don't rememb the sourc.

it's too bad the join command is not better implement, sinc it would
avoid us all those stupid drive letter.  i realiz that messdo wa
meant for casual, even ignor user, so "mount" all the drive in
on file tree might be confus. but, it look like ms is go to carri
thi over into window nt (anoth os meant for casual, even igor 
user -- not!).  with all it's old famili system baggag, mayb ms need
a recoveri group so thei can get on with life :-(.
