(some) modern (state space) control analysi and design method. the
notebook in cosi_pak follow a typic `control engin i' cours
taught at mani univers around the world for the junior/senior 
level undergradu. there is no fee to us cosi_pak but certain 
respons ar expect of the user (see copyright notic in the

     cosi_pak is avail by anonym `ftp' from

**********************************************************************

--> chang in version 0.9 (updat from v0.81 to v0.9)

	in thi version, we have revis cosi_pak to take advantag of 
the more robust signal process function avail in mathematica v2.1.  
sinc mathematica 2.1 provid a better  and  work 
laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function than 
mathematica v2.0 did, we adopt them. thi ha made cosi_pak 
smaller. thu brian evan' signal process packag that support 
the laplacetransform  and inverselaplacetransform function in the 
cosi_pak v0.81 ar no longer need directli by cosi_pak v0.9. for 
power user who  us signal process we still recommend the us of the veri  
fine  brian evan packag on signal process (avail at 
the anonym  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  ip # 130.207.226.24).  on  
the  downsid, the disadvantag of thi updat 
can be that mathematica 2.1 requir more runtim resourc than it 
previou version. 


***********************************************************************	
--> for mathematica 2.0 user
	
	we have includ the laplacetransform packag from mathematica 2.1 in  
the directori `for_2.0'. pleas move all file and directori under for_2.0 into  
the calculu directori under mathematica packag directori.

--> introduct
   
    thi is an unsupport releas of cosi_pak - a control system 
analysi packag for symbol control system analysi us 
mathematica 2.1. classic control system analysi and design method and some  
modern control system method have been implement in thi packag. 
    
    thi packag and the attend notebook were develop on a 
next (tm) comput (a unix base workstat). thei have been 
us as a supplementari teach aid along with  standard control 
engin text (ogata [1991], phillip and harbor [1991]) for 
undergradu cours in `control engin i' taught at the system 
engin depart of cwru. in addit to the next, thei have 
also been test successfulli on appl macintosh comput (tm), and, 
ibm pc's (tm) run ms window(tm). we would be veri much interest 
to hear from you if you or anybodi you know us thi softwar on 
platform not mention abov. ibm user howev will have to 
evalu the notebook first to visual the graphic.

    onc instal (see below for instruct), thi  collect  of  
mathematica  packag  can be load by ani user. bundl with the 
packag ar mani notebook ("cosi_note") which demonstr  
the function of these packag. the notebook follow a plan of 
mani fine, standard, undergradu control engin text book

--> compress file

        the file that contain  a  complet set of the cosi_pak v0.9
packag and notebook for mathematica ar:

 cosi_pak_09.tar.z     		compress tar file for unix system
	
 cosi_pak_09.sit.hqx     	compress sit file for macintosh 
 				system and encod by binhex 4.0 
				format (requir the   sharewar
				 stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 
	
 cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip    	zip file for the ibm pc run ms-do
    
     onc expand the mathematica file can also be us on 
macintosh / ibm pc / unix system also.


--> instal of cosi_pak

 o in unix command line type the follow command:

      zcat cosi_pak_09.tar.z | tar xvf -

 o in macintosh open the .sit.hqx file us the sharewar
    stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.
  
 o in ibm command line type the follow command:

      pkunzip -o -d cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip

note: thi .zip file wa zip by zip util v2.0. you must us 
pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  ibm pc's mai limit the 
directori name charact to eight. in that event type "pkunzip -o -d 
cosi_pak.zip.  you can also unzip the cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip file on ani 
unix machin if you have unzip util on it.


     uncompress and untar "cosi_pak_09.tar.z" or unzip 
"cosi_pak_ibm_09.zip" will creat a directori call "cosi_pak".
         	
onc the file ar expand you should see a singl directori 
"cosi_pak" contain the follow three file, four 
sub-directori and their content:

	at the begin of the "initi" cell of each notebook 
in  "cosi_note" directori, we list the exampl about how to make 
mathematica identifi the directori:

	(* initi of path *)

	(* exampl for a unix machin  (default) *) 
	(*
	$path=join[$path,
