why would you dispos a channel if you ar go to plai more
sound soon? if you ar try to write a game, you shouldn't
be us sndplai. instead, make a channel and us buffercmd
to plai sound on it. it work great. you can add callback to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is get
empti. befor it get empti.

callback ar veri reliabl, i found them 100% reliabl, even
under system 4.1. i wa do continu background sound with
interrupt sound effect on system 6.0 with the im-v
document.

you probabl were cancel your callback command out of
your channel, of cours you didn't get call. in gener, if
you have problem with sound work when you plai on per
channel and then close the channel (with the relat
slowdown), but then when you plai more than on you don't
work, then you ar ad more than on synthes to a
channel, possibl the same on multipl time. thi might be
becaus you ar call sndplai on a preexist channel with
a sound resourc which add the sampl sound synthes to
the channel first thing befor it plai. most sampl sound
have thi command at the start of them. you need to resedit
the sound and remov that command, then when you creat your
channel, specifi the sampl sound synthes to be the
channel's synth. then you can us asynch sndplai's all you
want. you'll probabl want to switch to buffercmd's, sinc you
ar go to have to us snddocommand anywai to add callback.

now befor you go ahead and tell me i am full of it, and the
sound manag doesn't work for game, rememb, spectr us
it. and it work great. if spectr can spare the cpu time, you
can too.

on littl disclaim: there ar some out there who sai the
sound manag in the iisi can't be made to work right. i'm not
sure either wai, but i know for sure that you can make your
sound work 100% correctli on everi other machin us the
sound manag.
