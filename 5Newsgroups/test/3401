i am not sure that i am suppos to post thi mail here. howev
dure the last year, while i wa involv in develop graphic user
interfac (gui) applic, i have enjoi be person part of thi
new group wherin i got some interest inform which help me in my
work. i am post my resum hope that peopl work in my area would
make time to look at it.

dear prospect employ:

i am seek employ as a softwar engin with interest in softwar
design and develop, in which i can util my experi in hardwar, 
c & c++ program, graphic user interfac (gui), oper system and
comput network.

i receiv my bachelor of engin (be) degre in electron
engin in 1990 and a m.s. degre in electr engin in dec 1992 
from iowa state univers. current i am enrol in a m.s. in comput
engin at iowa state univers.

dure my master program, as a research assist sinc jan 1991, i have
publish three paper includ on in the ieee transact on magnet.
these paper ar a reflect of the qualiti of my research and my abil
to learn new concept quickli.

i have been involv in mani project involv softwar develop and
have extens experi program in c, c++, fortran and assembl level. 
i am also familiar with oper system like unix, ultrix and ms-do.
i am familiar with motif/x program and current, as a research assist,
am involv in graphic user interfac (gui) design us the multiplatform 
gui toolkit xvt++. my experi also includ area such as oper system
and comput network, through cours work and project. i wa involv in the
studi of the design and develop of the intern of the xinu oper
system. i have also been involv in mani tcp/ip program project in
comput network.

while in colleg i learnt the import of clear and concis commun.
i have also learn a lot about time manag. in my m.s. program i
have maintain a 3.70 grade averag, work 20 hour per week and
have enjoi be involv in mani other extra curricular activ.

my softwar experi along with my hardwar background (electron
engin) would be veri help in my career goal as a softwar engin.
i request that my qualif mai kindli be review. i would like to
have an interview to discuss your employ need and my career goal. 
i am eager to hear from you soon.


sincer
