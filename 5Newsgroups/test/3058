my school is settinÿûg up a new network with both mac and appl ii's.  i'm
us to ethernet, and don't know muÿch about localtalk.  two thing:  first,
in macwherehous, btheÿy have powerus network connector, and the caption
lead you to belÿûiev that you can plug them into the phone line in the
build and have them work.  is thi true?  i've seen it done by run
sepÿerat phone cord, but never with real line.  second, if that doe work,
could you us a modem ÿhook up to that same line while the network wa
activ?  help would be greatli apprici.  btw-ÿ’run seper phone line 
is out of the question, the network wil  verri spread o.
