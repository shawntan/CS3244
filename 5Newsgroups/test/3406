well, yeah, but unlik tiff thei all do substanti more than encod
rectangular bitmap.  and the other ar hardli troubl free.  i hear that
it is quit common for cgm implement not to interoper.

the annoi thing about tiff is that is that along with the 50 us
option, there ar 100 stupid option.  the most egregi exampl is that
rather than pick a byte order and bit order and us it consist
in all tiff file, byte and bit order ar option and all tiff reader on
all machin, no matter what their natur byte order, have to be prepar
to do byte swap.  there ar four slightli differ fax format --
again, ani on of them would have been adequ.  rgb imag can be store
by pixel or by compon, complex without function, etc, etc.  i also
note that the tiff doc sai that aldu' experi show that lzw reliabl
compress as well or better than ani of the fax format, suggest that
none of the fax format ar realli us.

what's wors, a lot of the format aren't even implement veri well,
e.g., lzw limit code word to 12 bit, while 14 or 16 bit would have
provid substanti better compress.  and the lzw method compress
byte rather than pixel.

but the absolut worst thing about tiff is that ani vendor can regist
proprietari tiff code and format without even publicli document them.
thi mean that there is no wai to write a tiff reader that can reliabl
read all incom tiff file.  some standard.
