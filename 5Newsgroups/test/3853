bandwidth is unlik to be the problem, except over a wet string network.
on of major flaw of x is the horrend number of transact (and
henc process switch) that it forc upon a host.  actual measur
(hourli averag) ar 5 per second per log in user, which can lead to
20-50 or more process switch (depend on whether each event is
filter by the window manag as well as the applic and how
mani process ar need for each charact.)

while a blink cursor need onli the applic and the network
process, and doe not add ani transact, it will add someth like
10 process switch per second per user.  thi is a signific increas
in overhead, especi as the applic mai have quit a larg work
set.  if you want a rapidli blink cursor, there could be as mani
as 50.

if you want to go there, i wouldn't start from here!
