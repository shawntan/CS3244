   is so then it's up to the individu to make the choic whether or not to
   honour it and part with monei.  person if i wa in hi posit i would
   do exactli the same thing, john ha obvious put in lot of time and effort
   into xv and why shouldn't he receiv some monei for it.

it is interest to look at the chang(s) of mind that john ha had.

  also, if you find xv to be nifti, us, gener 'cool', and of
  some valu to you, your donat (not tax-deduct) would be greatli
  appreci.  $10 (u.s.) is probabl a fine amount to donat.
  folk who donat $25 and up will receiv a nice, bound copi of the xv manual
  print on a spiffo 600-dpi laser printer.  it'll look love mount over
  your fireplac.
