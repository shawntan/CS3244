i have a mac plu with 2.5mb ram. i have just bought an extra 2mb so that
i can have the max 4mb ram that a plu support. howev, i can't get it
to boot after i instal the 2 extra simm. instead i get a sad mac (sorri,
but i can't rememb the code). look at the motherboard, i can see
that 2 resistor have been snip off where it sai "256kb path -
1 row". i assum that wa done when the first 1mb simm were ad.

so, my question is: ar there ani other resistor that need snip? 
				or, do i have bum simm which need to be exchang?

ani and all advic will be appreci.
