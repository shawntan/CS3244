|      -	edit/plai with imag us aldu photostyl, run under

| 	3com etherlink iii 16bit
| 	maxtor 240mb id hard drive

| 486dx2-66 with isa and vlb,  or,   a 486dx-50 with eisa and no vlb (and thu

have in mind the size of the imag, my opinion is to go with vlb.
it ha _much_ more bandwith that eisa, which in fact can be util
by the craphic card. (i have not made measur, so someon els mai
share experi on that.)

also, the dx2/66 is faster in the oper, that run off intern
cach, slightli slower off the extern and about the same off memori.
so my advic is the 66/vlb.

have you tri run photostyl without the cach? no need to have
page and cach both. (well, you might argu, that the page is
cach). my belief (no measur) is that app left with more
memori will manag it better than smartdrv.ex(sy).

| i have perform a number of benchmark on the ethernet transfer rate.  thi

| on the same network.  go to the 16 bit version of the smc card increas
| transfer rate to 160k/sec - still veri slow (especi when move larg 
| imag).  is there such a thing as a local-bu ethernet card come??  will it
| make a differ?  i'm hope so, and lean toward the 486dx2-66 choic 
| (abov), for that reason.

the bandwidth (theoret) of isa is over 5mb/s, which is far from
0.15mb/s. i tri my isa id hard drive (maxtor 213mb) and got the
same result - 0.65mb/s - regardless of the isa bu speed
(5.5-8.25mhz). so i guess, that just the card/driver combin is
lousi.

| also, ar there dx2-100's on the horizon?  what about dx3-99's?  dx3-150's ???!

the rumor ar that dx3-99 (if ani) is the most like chip to come
out. but note, that ibm is closest to the technolog an it will onli
sell whole motherboard, so you'll have to upgrad the mb.

| ani inform is greatli appreci.

just some view, not much figur.
