thi mai work, but won't it involv invok the applic, e.g. if you
drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. print manag icon, won't it run
notepad and paintbrush befor print?  if you just want to drag a file
(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stai at front attribut, you
need an intellig print manag drag and drop client like amish print 2.0.
