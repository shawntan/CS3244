you ar stuck in a distribut system feedback loop!  what if you ar on an
xtermin or run xterm over the net to anoth machin?  that is when the
load problem occur.  if you had a machin with 20 xtermin attach and
thei all had blink cursor in xterm's, thi could repres a consider
ethernet bandwidth wast.

i'm not pick on you, just peopl keep forget that there is a lot of life
out there besid distribut or singleus "workstat"!
