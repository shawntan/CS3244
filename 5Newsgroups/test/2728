you can print to a file from an hp (or ani other printer).  just go into
the printer section of your control panel.  select the printer you want
to re-direct to a file, and click on connect.  then choos :file as the
port to connect the printer to.

when you print from ani applic to that printer, window will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to captur the
printout.

it's pretti easi.

good luck!
