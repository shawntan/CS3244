hi,

i am run x11r4 on an ibm rs/6000 (aix 3.2) and x11r5 on a sun4 (suno 4.1).

sinc i run x on both colour and black&white displai, i need differ
valu for the same resourc, so i want to us #ifdef color in my
applic default file. howev, cpp is onli invok by xrdb, and
not when the resourc ar load on demand.

is there a proper solut to thi?

so far, the onli proper solut i've come to think of, is to creat 2
differ file in my ~/app-default/, sai xterm and xterm-color, and
set my xfilesearchpath to either $home/%t/%n or $home/%t/%n-color.
but that doe not alwai seem to work (e.g. execut a remot shell
command without read the .cshrc doe not set xfilesearchpath).

furthermor, i thought of us #includ "xterm" in xterm-color.
howev, for resourc in xterm that i want to overrid in xterm-color,
thing ar differ on both machin. on a sun, the first found resourc
is us (i.e. the on from xterm, the b&w on), while on an rs/6000, the
last found valu is us (i.e. the on from xterm-color). what can i do
about it?

i have on last question: for the specif of xfilesearchpath, i
can us %t, %n, %c and %s. %t stand for app-default, %n for the
resourc class, but what do %c and %s stand for?

thank in advanc for repli,
marcel.
