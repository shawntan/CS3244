i hope someon can help me with the follow problem - i'm sure there
must be a known solut.

given a rectangl defin by

-x <= x <= x  and -y <= y <= y  where x and y ar constant

and a parallelogram defin by

-c1 <= a*x + b*y <= c1  and -c2 <= c*x + d*y <= c2

where c1, c2, a, b, c, d ar constant and b/a != d/c (i.e. not
parallel line)                                ^^
                                          not equal to

what is the area of their intersect?

   what i'm after is some gener algorithm suitabl for all rectangl
and parallelogram that can be describ by the abov equat.  at the 
moment it look like i'm go to have to look at all possibl case 
and examin each seper e.g.

1) rectangl enclos parallelogram. 

2) parallelogram enclos rectangl.

3) two corner of parallelogram insid rectangl

                             "

4) two corner of parallelogram outsid rectangl

   i hope someon can help.
