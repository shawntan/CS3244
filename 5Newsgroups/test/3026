fwb distribut hdt person edit (hdt = hard drive toolkit), which
is what i own. thi is less fanci than the "full" version, but good
enough for what you and i want to do. casa blanca offer drive7, but
i'm not that familiar with it. i *think* that both drive7 and hdt pe
can be had for around us$50.

i've us silverling at work (v 5.42??), and i like hdt pe much
better. imho it ha a better interfac, and easier to understand.

ani drive7 user?
