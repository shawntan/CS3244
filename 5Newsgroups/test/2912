pleas research carefulli.  just becaus a fax modem behav like
a printer on a "local" machin, doesn't guarante function 
when a "local" machin ha fax softwar print to a "remot
instal" fax card.  i tri thi with workgroup and the 
fax softwar didn't like it at all.  could have been winfax's
peculiar but i don't think so.  a lot of special hardwar
interact take place intern.  in my case, a fax manag
program mere "intercept" the print job and spool it to
it's own directori, not print manag's spool directori.  to
softwar, it appear the job wa "print".  print manag 
plai no part in the handl of the actual process.

pardon me if i've incorrectli assum thi is what you were
up to.  a trueli network-awar fax-modem will most like be
requir, or a lot of weird setup and tinker.

good luck.
