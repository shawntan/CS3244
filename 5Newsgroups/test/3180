my 610 is work great.  i haven't heard of ani problem.  sound
to me like your dealer doesn't know what he's talk about.  it's
pretti irrespons to not reccomend the centri 610 on the basi
of problem with on machin.  recommend the iivx over the lciii
doesn't make a lot of sens either.  if thi person is so convinc the 610
is buggi have thei talk to appl about it or ar thei just assum
it's a problem with all of them?
