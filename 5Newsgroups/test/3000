actual you fell into the abov becaus you said "i believ"
if you had us the rest of thi post in your previou post
i do not think anyon would have agru with you.

the follow three ar not the competit for window 3.0 (imho of cours)
system 7  -- doe not current run on intel box
nextstep  -- rather expens should be a competitor to window nt not 3.x
unix/x    --   "        "        "    " "      "     "    "     "   "   "


with the except of os/2 all of the abov will requir most user
to spend a veri larg sum of monei to upgrad applic to on that
run under these os's. and basic monei speak louder than anyth
els. you keep sai "more stabl multitask" is what you mean
"not multi-finder / gem / geowork co-oper multi-task but
real honest to good priorit pre-emptiv multi-task"?

basic thi is moot sinc most user have been abl to share data for
quit a long time, but ar still to blind to know it.

why pick it up? you state the reason behind your opinion. state them in 
a veri straight-forward, though over protect, manner. and asid from
my earlier comment about who actual is a competitor, i think we ar in
agreement.

doe tim glauert agre? let's wait and see.
