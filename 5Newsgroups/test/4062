certainli in the uk the 21mb floptic ar about the same price as a
cheap cd-rom now (you seem to be abl to get them for around gbp
200-250). howev the bigger optic drive (e.g. 128mb) ar much more
expens - around the gbp 1000 mark.

a coupl of question that someon mai be abl to answer - the 21mb
floptic - ar thei direct drop in replac for a floppi or do
thei need driver softwar etc. i.e. do you just rip out the floppi
drive, plug the same cabl into the floptic, stick in a flopti-disk
and hei presto you have a 21mb floppi. thi sound far too easi.

on the subject of soni develop md for comput, i have reread a
pcw articl on thi subject and there it sai that soni have been do
optic drive for other peopl for some time and mai be about to do a
product themselv. from the articl it seem that the audio md format
is a byproduct of their comput storag work - the md  mechan is
ident to their mo comput optic drive. a soni spokesman wa
quot as sai that a 2.5" md disk would hold about 100mb of data
though he refus to comment on ani possibl of thi be
product.

the articl said that on of the problem hold back develop in
thi area wa lack of sensibl standard plu there ar at least 2
distinct optic storag mechan around at present. given that it
probabl need md be us as a distribut medium to get it
into the market and sinc thi ha alreadi been corner by cd it
probabl need someon to come in with a veri strong market lead
to get md accept.
