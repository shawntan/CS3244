   we have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctli process
   #if claus in c preprocessor statement. it evalu everyth to
   true no matter what the condit ar.

   [...]

   ha anybodi come up with some solut/fix to 'makdepend' other than
   writeyourownpars... and will to share it with us?

rewrit 'makedepend' to us 'cc -m' or 'gcc -m' or 'gcc -mm' (which is
the on i prefer, sinc system header don't chang that often) for
gener the actual depend.  you'll still need to write the
part that edit the actual makefil.  i think there's a program in the
berkelei distribut call mkdep that will do essenti thi.
