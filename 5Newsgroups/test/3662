the colormap element of setwinattrib must be a legitim truecolor
colormap. so, us xcreatecolormap() with the proper visual and us it
in setwinattrib (and don't forget the mask!).

and the inevit caveat: i usual us widget, set the visual
and colormap resourc rather than direct x routin, so i could be
wrong. but, i think thi is the gener difficulti.
