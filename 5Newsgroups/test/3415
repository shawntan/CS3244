ye, i have both art & letter and coreldraw.  i person like
art & letter better but there ar thing i like about art & letter
that coreldraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  i haven't found the perfect
graphic program that doe everyth yet.  

my favorit featur from coreldraw is that it import alot of differ
format.  art & letter doe not.  i like the thousand of clipart
avail with art & letter.  howev, i do find look them up
in a book and referenc them by number to be annoi.

on of my major problem is that there isn't ani program avail on
the market for the artist depriv :-).
