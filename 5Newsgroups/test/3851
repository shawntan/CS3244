	help,

	i've got an applic with a seri of pushbutton across
	the top (a toolbar).  i want to add eventhandl to these
	pushbutton on enterwindowmask and leavewindowmask so that
	i can put up some descript text about the function of each
	pushbutton as the pointer cross over it.

	i've done thi fine, but i've turn up the follow problem:

	when the pushbutton ar sensit i get callback on both of
	the abov event, but when thei ar not sensit i onli get
	callback on leavewindow event.  thi seem odd.  i would
	expect thi to be an all-or-noth type of thing.

	is thi a bug?  if not, can someon explain thi behavior?

	thank,

	mark
