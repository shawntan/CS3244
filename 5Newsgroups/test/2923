what version of winfax do you have?  the newest version (3.0) ha an ocr
(optic charact recognit) built in... what thi mean is that it can
take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ascii so that on can edit
the document w/o re-type it... howev, i found that the ocr that come
packag with winfax doe not work as well as omnipag profession (also
by delrina softwar)... so, onc again, winfax ver. 3.0 ha what you ar
look for... good luck!
