sound like a memori conflict problem, which can caus truli weird symptom 
like these. call dell tech support (or better, post to them on cserv if you
have an account) and get the memori rang(s) us by video ram on your
machin. the block window from us those rang with an
emmexclud= statement in the 386enh section of system.ini. you probabl
should includ a statement exclud the same rang from emm386 or whatev
memori manag you us in config.sy.

dell "instal" window on the machin thei ship, but the instal doesn't
consist of much more than  copi the file to a hard disk. you still have
to do the work. and the fact that you have the problem in enhanc
mode but not standard strongli suggest a high memori conflict.
