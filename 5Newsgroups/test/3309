asecchia@cs.uct.ac.za (adrian secchia) write:
| when an incid rai (i) strike an object at point p ...  the reflect
| rai (r) and the transmit rai (t) is calcul from the formula.
| 
| call the routin recurs on r and t will return the colour 
| along the rai (r and t) as rcol and tcol. each object ha it own
| colour ocol and each light sourc ha licol (1 <= i <= n).
| 
| the question is: 
|   how do you combin rcol, tcol, ocol and all the licol's to get
|   the correct result colour to return along the i rai?

    first of all (thi is not a snide respons), if you're confus about
thi issu, you will stumbl over a lot of other thing as well.  i suggest
that the weak is your refer materi.  get "an introduct to rai
trace" by andrew glassner for veri good coverag of the raytrac
algorithm.  you could also refer to the 2nd edit of folei & van dam.

    on to the question.  the simpl answer is that you just keep ad up
all the contribut and then clamp at the maximum intens.  for
exampl, if your intens valu rang from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep ad up
and clamp the result valu to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower
bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulb, but that's anoth issu =^).  so, you
get some illumin equat like thi:

        i = lambient + ldiffus(light[n]) + lreflect + ltranspar

    the contribut due to reflect is just sum with the light
intens, as is the light due to transpar.  now, a slightli less
hand-wave illumin equat is thi:

        i = kala + kdld(light[n]) + krlr + ktlt

    that is, each compon of the illumin equat is govern by the
materi constant ka, kd, kr and kt.  so the maximum you can get from
transpar for a given object, for exampl, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a
purpl-color glass object.

    hopefulli thi answer your question.  i'll forward my "illumin
equat sermon" to you also.
