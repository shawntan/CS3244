diamond video card (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) 
mai have excel specif, and the window driver that
come with them might make window blindingli fast, but:

if you're consid bui a system, with a view to us
it to run unix (linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special softwar,
there is a good chanc that it will not work with the diamond card.
thi is due to diamond's proprieti attitud to it's hardwar:
it's imposs to get free inform from them about their chip 
(specif their dot-clock) without pai, and sign non-disclosur
agreement.

thi made it imposs for the free softwar foundat to provid
x-window compat with these card, as diamond didn't want to 
divulg program neccess.

as far as i know onli diamond ha thi proprieti on it's info.


mark.
