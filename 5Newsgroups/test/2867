seen from a typograph point of view, atm us postscript font
is better than truetyp; the hint mechan incorpor in ps is
gorgeou.
multilingu user mai see the limit of possibl differ charact in
a ps font as problemat; thei mai have better us of the unicod
featur of tt font (in window nt).

i've seen *lot* of realli beauti and printabl-in-small-size ps font;
i haven't seen those as tt font. most of them ar render quit
inaccur (in small size, esp. as screen font).
simpli compar timesnewroman as a ps font with the tt font; the first
look better.

i am hope that there will be atm/nt !
