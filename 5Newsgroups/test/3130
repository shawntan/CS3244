is there a wai to connect a powerbook 145, mac iisi, and person laserwrit
ls so that i can (not necessarili silmultaneoulsi) print from either the iisi,
or pb, and file share between the iisi and pb?
i know i can get the ($expens$) lw nt upgrad for my ls, but i can't afford
that...
 
thank, mark
