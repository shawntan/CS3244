put me down for a pb100 4/20 with ext. floppi, appletalk remot acc,
ac adapt, and fresh out of box (wa us, but buyer switch to 140
on arriv and sold unopen box. purchas last octob for $925.
later i bought a us powerport v.32 9600 bp intern fax-modem for
someth like $225, i'm us right now! work great!  :)

no real complaint. i love my portabl system (got a color home setup
also. mac ii). reason wa that matlab program at school and other
simul of dynam control system sometim took hour (or
overnight) to run, ty up my mac ii. i got the pb100 with fast modem
to do light work and on-the-run stuff. i figur i'd give it to my
littl sister next year when she goe to colleg. it's run system
7.1 now without ani problem. also i sometim do dec4015 termin
emul with matlab on our univers's vax_vm (nice thing that it
benchmark itself as an averag of 230 time faster than a mac iifx).
so, the pb100 just doe graphic output and termin emul (not
too hard at all for it). it wa a fabul setup !!!!  :)  weeee!!!

(by the wai, all matlab softwar wa on class account. i wa also the
ta for a class that us simulab/simulink. we had site-licens and
take-home, then-destroi later site-releas licens... no pirat
there, incas you're wonder.... great program!!! )

just like to add, whatev futur system you get, you can almost never
get enuff memori.... bui it while it's cheap - that is bui it when you
get the comput sinc it's usual cheaper than upgrad... i alwai
run out of disk space... but i have a syquest on the mac iisi, so i
never worri about space befor... got sever cart).
