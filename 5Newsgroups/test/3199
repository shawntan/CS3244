hmmm... that's not quit right.  the performa 600 is real darn close
to the iivx (but a better bui imo).  i also don't think thei ar so
much a 'low-cost busi solut', but a low-cost _home_ solut.
why els bundl at eas (among other thing)?  hardli a busi
applic. 

what do you mean by 'no "retail price"'.  quit the contrari, i think.
the price is darn near the same all across the countri.  that (again,
imo) wa on of the sell point of the performa -- ie: no haggl
requir.  kinda like the saturn (car) of the comput set.  on
price, medium perform, readi to go.

when i shop for my performa (600cd), the differ between sear
(*sigh), montgomeri ward, silo (*sigh), circuit citi (*sigh*) and
bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  why i chose on over the
other wa base sole on avail and a friendli salesman who
went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someon who
sell appl?).  admittedli, except for montgomeri ward (and i
suspect i wa just lucki) all of the salesfolk i spoke to didn't know
didli about the comput, peece or mac.  but then, neither did ani
of the  appl dealer i spoke with...

if you would've told me a year ago that i would bui a macintosh from
montgomeri ward i woulda laugh for a long, long time.  go figur.
i'm *real* happi with my performa.  oh, and i bought the appl
performa plu monitor (vs. bui 3rd parti).  happi with that
decis as well.  i walk in, plop down some cash, and walk out
with a spankin' new comput the dai befor christma.
