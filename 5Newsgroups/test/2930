   after hear endless debat (read: name-call) over which os is better, do
   and window or os/2 and final have enought resours to plai with a coupl
   of differ oper system, i have decid to put the two product to a
   head to head test, as so mani fellow newspost have suggest.  i have, 
   howev, no desir whatsoev to us a version of os/2 which wont realli
   do what it sai (i.e. run window app)  os/2 2.0-2.1 will not run window
   app in 386 enhans mode, someth that most larger window app requir, but
   os/2 2.2, which is suppos to be in beta test, is suppos to.  i have heard
   that os/2 2.2 beta is avail via ftp, and i wa wonder if anyon knew
   where to obtain a copi.  i would appreci ani inform, as i would like, 
   onc and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my need.

if you wait until mai the 18th you will be abl to bui the new os/2
2.1 sinc it will be releas at comdex that dai. it will run window
3.1 app and window enh. mode. if you can't wait, then you can ftp a
6 month old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but thi version is
probabl a lot slower than the final product.

when you do your test, pleas have in mind that a singl task
system will alwai be faster at do on task. the real power of os2
li in the multitask and can't realli be measur by a stopwatch.

happi benchmark.
