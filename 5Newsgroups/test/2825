i have just upgrad from a trident tvga9000 to an ati graphic ultra (the
old mach8 chip).  i am quit pleas with the perform so far, but have
on problem.  when us window in 800x600, i have notic that the 
tile bar and scroll bar ar significantli larger than thei were when i
wa us the trident card.  is there a set in my .ini file that i can
chang to make these smaller ?  i could not find the faq for thi list...
