in my quest for speed, i've run into a problem. 66.66 mhz and 80 mhz
clock oscil ar avail but i haven't found ani speed between
66.66 and 70 mhz for further test. fox electron (813) 693-0099 can make custom oscil but if anyon know a sourc cheaper than $12/osc pleas
let me know. some 68 and 70 mhz unit would complet my speed trial on the
old q700
