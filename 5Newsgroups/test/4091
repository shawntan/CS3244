file which we would like to make read onli.  i have us the do attrib command
but some peopl, who carri around the attrib program in their pocket,
have still been abl to eras some of the more import file.  ar
there ani softwar packag which would make an entir drive read-onli?
an exampl, partit the drive into two partit and have the first
drive contain the import file which can be onli read and the second
drive you could both read and write.  
  ani and all enquiri or help would be appreci.
