you can't custom a command line interfac?  where have you been?  i
can chang the prompt, i can make alias (so someon like me who is
us to sai, ls, can type it on my do machin and still get a
directori list), and under unix, if i don't like the command line
interfac, i throw it out and get a differ on. (csh, bash, ksh,
sh, etc...)

a decent gui for all variat of unix? lesse... what about motif?
or the stuff from mit? (twm come to mind...) those ar pretti
standard. heck, an xwindow program run like it like to -- all the
end user ha to realli know is how to manipul the actual window
with the mous, and sinc it is a gui, it's *graphic* and a bit
easier to figur out. (someth the window peopl have been press
down our throat for some time now...)

the thing i fear is that there will be a gap between the normal user
run window (all flavor) and the other "power" user run unix
and other more advanc os. at least right now, do is still pretti
much king. i can bring a copi of my latest whiz-bang program demo
over to my friend hous, and sinc we both run do, he can enjoi it
too.
