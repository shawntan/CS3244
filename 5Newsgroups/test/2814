there wa a post about someth similar a while back.  it seem window
doe *not* take it upon itself to free up ani sy. resourc an
applllic is us when that applic is done.  that job is left
entir to the applic.  that is, the applic ha to clean up
after itself when it quit.

anyon out there know if there is a util for window which  will
clean up sy. resourc when an applic quit (mother.zip???).

peac,
mickei
