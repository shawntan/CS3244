the gl file is an archiv contain individu frame or piec of
frame (usual store as .pic or .clp file), font, and a .txt file
that tell the grasp anim system how to displai it.  gl stand
for grasp librari.  there is probabl a detail discuss of thi subject
in the alt.binari.pictur faq.

there ar freeli distribut viewer for gl file, and thei ar usual
name grasprt?.ex (replac the ? with a version digit or letter).  most
gl file contain frame that ar hardwar-specif to particular mode
of the cga, ega, or vga adapt on pc.  i think that there ar some
copi of grasprt avail by anonym ftp (i know that i got on there
a long time ago).

		good luck
