i would like to know as well, sinc i just bought a 200mb seagat id
drive and want to add it to my comput (a four-year-old gatewai
386/20), which current ha an 80mb seagat scsi drive.  the scsi
control is such that the doc told me not to specifi it in the cmo
setup, i.e. both hard drive set ar list as "not instal,"
and appar the scsi control work it wonder.  i wonder if
thi is a problem.  also, i rememb how, when i help my cousin
instal hi second id drive, we had to defin a master/slave
relationship for them; do i need to do someth similar here?

>i am particularli interest in have the scsi as the _boot_ drive.
