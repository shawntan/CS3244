	thi is on of the trickiest problem w/ win 3.1 ... person i run
telix 3.2 for do under window just fine (and 've been wait for the win
version froever... :) ), but i have to admit i am the except to the rule:
i have tri instal variou do comm prog on friend' machin, most of
them w/ big problem... some of the stuff you have to lookout for: 
1) alwai run the prog thru a .pif, never by call it .ex, 2) in the .pif
_alwai_ toggl on _lock_applic_memori_ --actual thi is someth
ms point out in the readm.wri file, and is especi critic for download
3) go under ctrl panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your com port 'alwai warn'
--it will help u w. debug thi thing and it's 'healthier' 4) check where
ar u run the mous from - com port - 5) check the com port address from
your bio setup and from ctrl panel/port/(setup?)/advanc..
these might help u... if yu still have problem, get $100 and bui procomm+win..,
:) hope it help somehow...
