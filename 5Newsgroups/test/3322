well for starter, why us rle file?  you might have a specif program that
need them, ok, but i tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thu a 2.4meg
24bit targa file becom a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.

the latest version of xv (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimag (3.03) both handl jpeg file.
and the best wai to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  even at 90%
qualiti (you can't see the differ) the jpeg is wai smaller than anyth
els even an 8bit gif!

later'ish
