  i had a similar problem with my stylewrit i (the origin!).
have you tri clean the print head? with the swii driver, it's
and option in the print dialog box. sometim i had to do it sever
time to get the crud out. ye it wast ink, but it beat those
white annoi line.
  anoth idea is to print a coupl of page with just a big
black box. it can help to get the ink flow.
  good luck!
