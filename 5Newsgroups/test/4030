i've notic a recent prolifer of 1 gig scsi-2 3.5" drive, in
particular, the fujitsu 2694 and the micropoli 2112. there is also the
maxtor lxt1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive. thei ar all quit cheap,
and have nice 3-5 year warranti. 

my question ar: is there a catch?
                  which on is better?
                  what type of scsi-2 do these drive us?
                  is the servic gener better for on of these     
         
                  manufactur?
