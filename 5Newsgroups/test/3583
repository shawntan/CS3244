i've found that i have to add the "-8" option for displai jpeg
with the new version.  for some reason, if i don't, it goe into
24-bit mode and the result imag is displai with 216 color 
(from a 6x6x6 arrai) instead of 256 and look grainier.  sinc i'm
on the ubiquit 8-bit pseudo color displai i would have thought it
could tell that.
