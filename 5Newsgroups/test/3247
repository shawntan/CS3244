i have a question for y'all:

i'm look at an ad for the new 3.5" fast scsi-2 drive from micropoli
in the june, 1993, macworld. (i have seen similar ad for the id version
in ibm pc magazin)

well, the ad sai that all three drive have a fast scsi-2 interfac,
but then it sai that the dtr rate for each drive is 5 megabyt/second,
*max*.

how can thi be?  i thought that if a drive wa to be fast scsi-2 it
had to have a dtr of 10meg a second?

(i am assum the 5meg/sec claim by micropoli is from the 512k cach.
i admit that i would be veri impress if the drive can *read/write* data
at 5meg a second!)

thank you.
