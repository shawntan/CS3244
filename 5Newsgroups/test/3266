an automat mail handler at brown univers allow user of "comput
graphic: principl and practic," by folei, van dam, feiner, and
hugh, to obtain text errata and inform on distribut of the
softwar packag describ in the book.  also, user can send the
author feedback, to report text error and softwar bug, make
suggest, and submit exercis.  to receiv inform describ
how you can us the mail handler, simpli mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu
and put the word "help" in the subject line.  us the subject line
"softwar-distribut" to receiv inform specif concern
the softwar packag srgp and sphig.

errata for "an introduct to rai trace" is avail on
wuarchiv.wustl.edu in graphic/graphic/book/introtort.errata.

errata for "digit imag warp" is in the same directori as
"digit-imag-warp.errata".

all c code from the "graphic gem" seri is avail via anonym ftp
from princeton.edu.  look in the directori pub/graphic/graphicsgem for
the variou volum (gem, gemsii, gemsiii), and get the readm file first.

errata to _graphic gem_ and _graphic gem ii is avail on
wuarchiv.wustl.edu in graphic/graphic/book.

a list of comput graphic, comput geometri and imag process
journal is avail from juhana kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi.


2) draw three-dimension object on a two-dimension screen.

the simpl answer is, you divid by the depth.  for a more verbos
explan, see ani of the abov refer, start with:

the folei & van dam & feiner & hugh "comput graphic" book is certainli
a good start.  chapter 6 is "view in 3d", then read chapter 15,
"visibl-surfac determin".  for more inform go to chapter 16 for
shade, chapter 19 for clip, and branch out from there.


3) quantiz 24 bit imag down to 8 bit.

find a copi of "color imag quantiz for frame buffer displai" by
paul heckbert, siggraph '82 proceed, page 297.  there ar other
algorithm, but thi on work well and is fairli simpl.  implement
ar includ in most raster toolkit (see item 7 below).

a variant method is describ in "graphic gem", p. 287-293.  note that
the code from the "graphic gem" seri is all avail from an ftp site,
as describ abov.

check out john bradlei's "divers algorithm", which is incorpor into
the xv packag and describ in the back of the manual.

the imagemagick packag (see section 7 for where it is) contain anoth
quantiz algorithm which is present as "do a better job than the
other algorithm, but slower".

there's also an implement of:

wan, wong, and prusinkiewicz, _an algorithm for multidimension data
cluster_, transact on mathemat softwar, vol. 14 #2 (june, 1988),
pp. 153-162.

avial as princeton.edu:pub/graphic/colorqu.shar.  thi code,
in modifi form, appear in the utah raster toolkit as well.


4) convert color into grayscal.

the ntsc formula is:

    luminos = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue


5) quantiz grayscal to black&white.

the onli refer you need for thi stuff is:

    digit halfton, robert ulichnei, mit press 1987, isbn 0-262-21009-6

but befor you go off and start code, check out the imag manipul
softwar mention in item 7 below.  all of the packag mention can do
some form of grai to b&w convers.


6) rotat a raster imag by an arbitrari angl.

the obviou but wrong method is to loop over the pixel in the sourc
imag, transform each coordin, and copi the pixel to the destin.
thi is wrong becaus it leav hole in the destin.  instead,
loop over the pixel in the destin imag, appli the *revers*
transform to the coordin, and copi that pixel from the sourc.
thi method is quit gener, and can be us for ani on-to-on
2-d map, not just rotat.  you can add anti-alias by do
sub-pixel sampl.

howev, there is a much faster method, with antialis includ,
which involv do three shear oper.  the method wa origin
creat for the im raster toolkit (see below); an implement is
also present in pbmplu.  refer: "a fast algorithm for raster
rotat", by alan paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) graphic
interfac '86 (vancouv).  an articl on the im toolkit appear in
the same journal.  an updat version of the rotat paper appear
in "graphic gem" (see section [1]) under the origin titl.


7) free imag manipul softwar.

there ar a number of toolkit for convert from on imag format to
anoth, do simpl imag manipul such as size scale, plu
the abov-mention 24 -> 8, color -> grai, grai -> b&w convers.
here ar pointer to some of them:

pleas do *not* post or mail messag sai "i can't ftp, could someon
mail thi to me?"  there ar a number of autom mail server that will
send you thing like thi in respons to a messag.  see item 13 below for
detail on some.

also, the newsgroup alt.graphic.pixutil is specif for discuss
of softwar like thi.  you mai find us inform there.


8) format document for tiff, iff, biff, nff, off, fit, etc.

you almost certainli don't need these.  read the abov item 7 on free
imag manipul softwar.  get on or more of these packag and
look through them.  chanc ar excel that the imag convert you
were go to write is alreadi there.  but if you still want on of the
format document, mani such file ar avail by anonym ftp from
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directori pub/graphic.format.

these file were collect off the net and ar believ to be correct.
thi archiv includ pixel format, and two- and three-dimension object
format.  the futur of thi archiv is uncertain at the moment, as mark
hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will appar no longer be maintain it.

a second graphic file format archiv is now be activ maintain
by quincei koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  the latest version exist at
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.format/graphic.format.  appar,
neither of these is complet, you might want to check both.

fit stand for flexibl imag transport system. it's a file format most
often us in astronomi.  despit the name, it can contain not onli imag
but other thing as well.  there is a regular monthli fit basic and
inform post on sci.astro.fit - read it if you want to know more.



9) convert between vector format.

a lot of peopl ask about convert from hpgl to postscript, or macdraw
to cgm, or whatev.  it is import to understand that thi is a veri
differ problem from the imag format convers in item 7.  convert
on imag format to anoth is a fairli easi problem, sinc onc you
get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic object
ar the same for all imag format.  thi is not so for vector format.
the basic object -- circl, ellips, drop-shadow pattern-fill
round-corner rectangl, etc. -- vari from on format to anoth.
except in extrem restrict case, it is simpli not possibl to do
a on-to-on convers between vector format.

there is softwar for convert to and from cgm file on ftp.psc.edu.  the
contributor state that it run on unix, ms-window, and possibl the mac.
a better, more specif blurb would be most welcom.

on the other hand, it is quit possibl to do a close approxim,
render an imag from on format us the primit from anoth.
as far as i know, no on ha put togeth a gener toolkit of such
convert, but two differ hpgl to postscript convert have been
post to comp.sourc.misc.  check the index on your nearest archiv
site.

a relat frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmap imag - from postscript to sun raster format, or hpgl to
x11 bitmap.  for exampl, some of the commerci postscript clone for
pc's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  also,
the postscript interpret in the next box and in sun's x11/new can
be us to render to a file if you're clever.  but in gener, the
answer is no.  howev, if someon were to put togeth a vector to
vector convers toolkit, ad a vector to raster convert would be
trivial.

gnu ghostscript (from the fsf - current version 2.5.2) includ
driver for both ppm and gif format file, thu it can be us as
a postscript to ppm  or a postscript to gif filter.  (it implement
essenti all of postscript level 1 and alot of displai postscript
and level 2).


10) how to get pixar film.

the variou john lasset / pixar comput anim short ar avail
on video tape.  you can order them from direct cinema limit:

    film                           individu price      institut price
    luxo, jr.				$14.95			$50.00
    red's dream				$19.95			$75.00
    tin toi				$24.95			$75.00
    knickknack				$24.95			$75.00
    luxo, jr./red's dream/tin toi	$39.95			$100.00

all tape ar on 1/2" vh ntsc.  add $10/tape for pal format.  also
avail:

    tin toi t-shirt			$15.00
    knickknack 3d t-shirt		$15.00 (includ glass)

for individu order, add $5 s&h for the first tape or shirt, $2 for
each addit tape or shirt.  for institut order, add $5 s&h
for the first tape, $3 for each addit tape.  foreign ship, add
$3/tape or shirt.  call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 intern,
213-396-3233 fax) to charg to your credit card.  call first to verifi
price and avail.  or, just write to:

    direct cinema limit
    1749 14th street
    santa monica, ca 90404-4342

allan braunsdorf ha thi to sai:

at siggraph thei were sell a tape with all four short
for $25.  that wa a sale price.  you can get it for slightli
more than that normal.  ($35 mayb.)  i believ it's
avail from renderman retail (at pixar's address).

    pixar
    1001 west cut blvd.
    richmond, ca. 94804
    (510) 236-4000 
    (510) 236-0388 (fax)

you can obtain a video directli from pixar which contain "luxo, jr.", "red's
dream", "tin toi" and "knicknack" for $25.00, plu $2.50 for ship. thei
will take your order over the phone or via fax with a major credit card. i 
order mine just last week and receiv it sever dai later. don't expect 
to be abl to rent a copi from your local video store. accord to the licens
agreement print on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rent.


11) how do i draw a circl as a bezier (or b-spline) curv?

the short answer is, "you can't."  unless you us a ration spline you
can onli approxim a circl.  the approxim mai look accept,
but it is sensit to scale.  magnifi the scale and the error of
approxim magnifi.  deviat from circular that were not
visibl in the small can becom glare in the larg.  if you want to
do the job right, consult the articl:

  "a menageri of ration b-spline circl"
  by lesli piegl and wayn tiller
  in ieee comput graphic and applic, volum 9, number 9,
  septemb, 1989, page 48-56.

for rough, non-ration approxim, consult the book:

  comput geometri for design and manufactur
  by i. d. faux and m. j. pratt,
  elli horwood publish, halst press, john wilei 1980.

for the best known non-ration approxim, consult the articl:

  "good approxim of circl by curvatur-continu bezier curv"
  by tor dokken, morten daehlen, tom lych, and knut morken
  in comput aid geometr design, volum 7, number 1-4 (combin),
  june, 1990, page 33-41 [elsevi scienc publish (north-holland)]


12) how to order standard document.

the american nation standard institut sell ansi standard, and also
iso (intern) standard.  their sale offic is at 1-212-642-4900,
mail address is 1430 broadwai, ny ny 10018.  it help if you have the
complet name and number.

some us number to know:

cgm (comput graphic metafil) is iso 8632-4 (1987).  gk (graphic
kernel system) is ansi x3.124-1985.  phig (programm's hierarch
interact graphic system) is ansi x3.144-1988.  ig is asm/ansi
y14.26m-1987.  languag bind ar often separ but relat number;
for exampl, the gk fortran bind is x3.124.1-1985.

standard-in-progress ar made avail at kei mileston to solicit
comment from the graphic public (thi includ you!).  ansi can let
you know where to order them; most ar avail from global engin
at 1-800-854-7179.


13) how to ftp by email.

there ar a number of site that archiv the usenet sourc newsgroup
and make them avail via an email queri system.  you send a messag
to an autom server sai someth like "send comp.sourc.unix/fbm",
and a few hour or dai later you get the file in the mail.

in addit, there is at least on ftp-by-mail server.  send mail to
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com sai "help" and it will tell you how to us
it.  note that thi servic ha at time been turn off due to abus.


14) how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.

consid a rai origin at the point of interest and continu to
infin.  if it cross an odd number of polygon edg along the wai,
the point is within the polygon.  if the rai cross an even number of
edg, the point is either outsid the polygon, or within an interior
hole form from intersect polygon edg.  thi idea is known in
the trade as the jordan curv theorem; see eric hain' articl in
glassner's rai trace book (abov) for more inform, includ
treatment of special case.

anoth method is to sum the absolut angl from the point to all
the vertic on the polygon.  if the sum is 2 pi, the point is insid,
if the sum is 0 the point is outsid.  howev, thi method is about an
order of magnitud slower than the previou method becaus evalu the
trigonometr function is usual quit costli.

code for both method (plu barycentr triangl test) can be found in
the rai trace new, vol. 5, no. 3, avail from princeton.edu:
pub/graphic/rtnew/rtnv5n3.z.


15) how to tessel a sphere.

on simpl wai is to do recurs subdivis into triangl.  the
base of the recurs is an octahedron, and then each level divid
each triangl into four smaller on.  jon leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>
ha post a nice routin call sphere.c that gener the coordin.
it's avail for ftp on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.

16) specif refer on rai-trace and global illumin.

rick speer maintain a cross-index rai-trace bibliographi:

highlight of thi edit-

    i) more than 500 citat span the period from 1968 through
       novemb '91;
    ii) paper from all siggraph, graphic interfac, eurograph, cg
        intern and ausgraph proceed through decemb, '91;
    iii) all citat keyword for easi lookup;
    iv) cross-indic by keyword and author;
    v)  glossari of the 119 keyword us.

the bib is in the form of a postscript file.  the printout is 41 page long.
below is a list of ftp site and the dir that contain the file. it's name
"speer.raytrac.bib.ps.z" and is compress at most site-

(2) by electron mail
    send mail to
       archiv-server@siggraph.org
    you can retriev either the  text  or  rtf  file.  we suggest that you
    first retriev the index file by put on of the messag
       send panel91-txt index
       send panel91-rtf index
    in the subject or bodi of the messag.  you will get the necessari
    inform to retriev the actual transcript file.


19) graphic mail list

there ar a varieti of graphic-relat mail list out there, each

21) what about gif?

gif stand for graphic interchang format.  it is portabl and usabl upon
a wide varieti of platform.  it is quit limit in some wai (ye, the
keeper of the faq ha some opinion after all), and in fact, i don't like
it much.  howev, it look to me like the most-frequent ask question
which wa not previous cover in thi list.  the follow is a list
of newsgroup and the like where on could go to find out about gif.

        morph_intro.txt.z    (text version)
        m_respons.z        (respons to morph question)

the file ar compress, so you must us binari transfer and
uncompress them afterward.


23) how to rai-trace height field

height field ar a special case in rai-trace.  thei have a number of us,
such as terrain render, and some optim is possibl.  thu, thei
get their own faq section.  note that further refer can no doubt be
locat via the rai-trace bib in section 16 abov.

the follow paper seem to be the definit refer:

f. kenton musgrav
grid trace: fast rai trace for height field
juli, 1988
<musg88.ps.z>

thi is avail as "research report yaleu/dc/rr-639" from yale univers,
it's also in the siggraph '91 fractal model in 3d comput graphic and
imag cours note, and (best of all) it's avail on the net:

    nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/paper/musg88.ps.z
    weedeat.math.yale.edu	pub/paper/musg88.ms.z

24) how to find the area of a 3d polygon

	the area of a triangl is given by (in c notat),

     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -
	            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );

and the area of a planar polygon is given by

     area = 0.0;

     for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )
         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );
     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );
     area /= 2.0;

if the area is a neg number, the polygon or triangl is
clockwis, if posit, it is counterclockwis.

>from ronald golman's gem (in graphic gem ii - see section 1 abov), "area
 of planar polygon and volum of polyhedra:"

the area of a polygon p0, p1, p2, ... pn, not in the x-y plane, is
given by

     area(polygon) = 1/2 * | n . sigma { pk x pk+1 } |

where n is the unit vector normal to the plane and p is a polygon
vertex.  the . repres the dot product oper and the x
repres the cross product oper.  sigma repres the summat
oper.  | | repres the absolut valu oper.  pn+1 is equal
to p0.


25) how to join acm/siggraph
