you bet your bippi it's built like a tank.. and not just mechan either!

thi past weekend we had a nasti thunderstorm and the imposs (*&^%)
happen - i got a direct lightn strike on my hous - and to the second
floor outlet box into which my faith deskjet 500c wa connect. there
wa a .303-bullet-size hole in the aluminum side with some solidifi
aluminum slag drip from it. you could actual see the electr box
through the hole! the outlet itself wa fri and i'm still amaz the
whole damn hous didn't burn down.

i lost 2 electr garag door open,  2 vcr's, 2 telephon (all of which
were on the opposit side of the hous), a zyxel u-1496e high speed modem,
a vga monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the rs232 and parallel port on my
x termin and a wd lan card in my pc. not a good night!

but, the deskjet ran as soon as i found a function serial and parallel
port to connect to it.
