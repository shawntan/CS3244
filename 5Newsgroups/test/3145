research ha shown that the major of the time that the unit
state' 30 to 35 million person comput ar on, thei ar not
activ be us.  in addit, 30 to 40 percent ar left run
at night and on weekend.

comput equip is now the fastest grow privat-sector us
of electr.  comput alon ar believ to account for five
percent of commerci electr consumpt, and mai account for
ten percent by the year 2000.

if you ar on of those who leav them on after you're done, it
would be a big environment benefit if you would just turn it off
when you're not us it.  it onli take a second or two to do.

also, the major of the power your comput us is not consum
by the comput itself, but by the monitor.  if you can't turn the
comput off, then pleas just turn off the monitor.

the u.s. environment protect agenc ha form an allianc
with comput manufactur to promot the introduct of energi-
effici pc that "power down" automat when not be us
and thu reduc the air pollut caus by power gener.  these
new comput will save enough electr to power both vermont and
new hampshir and save up to 1 billion u.s. dollar in annual
electr bill.  look for the special epa "energi star" logo when
you bui comput.  thei should be avail in on to two year.

accord to the epa studi, the energi save will prevent co2
emiss of 20 million ton annual, the equival of five million
automobil.  also, 140,000 ton of so2 and 75,000 ton of nitrogen
oxid emiss will be save; these ar the major pollut
respons for acid rain.

pleas do your part ... be respons.  if you're not us it,
then just turn it off.

inform herein is partial taken from the 1993 "inform
pleas" almanac, page 573, and the u.s. envirnoment protect
agenc's "environment new."

pleas redistribut thi messag to everi comput bulletin board,
network, memo system, etc. you can think of.  archiv it and post
it everi so often if you can.  let's get the word out to everyon.
we need to be respons about the wai we consum.
