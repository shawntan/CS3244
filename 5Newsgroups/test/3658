i us it all dai everi dai (maintain our ftp site and answer mail
via support@qdeck.com), and i can honestli sai that in the last few
month i've never had my machin go down due to ani sort of tcpip network
manag instabl. (of cours, i've crash my machin quit a few time
on purpos, dure beta test and that sort of thing, but the tcpip
portion is quit stabl...)

howev, keep in mind that dvx and the network manag ar onli go
to be as stabl as the softwar thei sit on top of (so if your underli
network kernel is flakei, you can't expect dvx to be terribl stabl...)

it just goe as a window that ha graphic drawn into it. (to vastli
over-simplifi what goe on, we just take the window graphic api call,
and translat them directli to x-protocol; unfortun, window wa
not realli written to be network-awar, so sometim we see a speed
penalti when an app doe someth stupid, like send a big white bitmap
to eras someth rather than just draw a white box; fortun,
that sort of thing is rare...)

you need to run ms window, which word then run insid. you could run
multipl window program within the on winx window, and window ha
wai to automag start winapp when you start window, so in practic
it's not realli a major problem. i have my system set up so that i can
run winx, which automat start word full-screen (for window), so
i never see ani part of window but word...)
