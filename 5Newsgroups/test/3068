we just receiv an appleon color scanner for our lab.  howev,
i am have troubl get reason scan output when print 
a scan photo on a laserwrit iig. i have tri scan at a 
higher resolut and the displai on the screen appear veri nice.  
howev, the print version is come out ugli!  

is thi due to the resolut capabl of the printer?  or ar 
there trick involv to get better qualiti?   or should we be 
get someth (like photoshop) to "pretti up" the imag?
i will appreci ani suggest.
