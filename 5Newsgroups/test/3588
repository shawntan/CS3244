hello,

	i am admin for an rs/6000 run aix 3.2, x11r5, motif, and xdt3.
	i want to prevent the user from hit cntl-alt-bkspc to exit x.
	
	i've tri invok x with 'xinit -t', but that doesn't work.
	xinit append the -t to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the
	call to x.  

	the man page to xinit is no help.  in fact, it tell
	me that xinit is a script when it is realli a binari file.  

	so far, the onli wai i've been abl to accomplish thi feat is
	to add the -t to the call to x in /usr/lpp/x11/default/xserverrc.
	i would rather not do it thi wai.  doe anyon have ani other idea?
