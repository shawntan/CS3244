thi problem is caus by a bad interact between the wai olwm repar
window, a misfeatur of the x protocol, and a bug in the xt intrins.  

the intrins bug is that it ignor the (x,y) posit given in
reparentnotifi event.  olwm is structur in such a wai that, when a window
is pop down, the last event the client receiv is a reparentnotifi event. 
at thi point, the intrins' notion of the shell's locat is out of date.

if a setvalu is done us the same (x,y) posit, the intrins think it
need to move the shell, so it issu a configurewindow request to move it
there.  howev, a (mi)featur of the x protocol is that a configurewindow
request that ha no effect will gener no configurenotifi event.  the
intrins thu wait for an event that will never arriv, and time out after
wmtimeout ha expir.  (actual, thing ar somewhat more complex becaus
the request is redirect to the window manag, but the net result is the
same.)

the solut is for the intrins to note the (x,y) posit inform
in reparentnotifi event.  thi ha been implement and is avail in x11r5
public fix 20.  thi is xbug 5513 for those of you who ar interest in
gorier detail.
