   i am set up my do/unix box on a 116m id and a 412m scsi drive
and wa wonder about the us of the (ms-do 5.0) join command.  i
like the wai it set thing up sinc i won't have to stick with the c:
d: & e: (crap) that do enforc.  i like how it would mimic mount
point of unix filesystem.  i have heard that there were problem
with us it, or at least under older version of do.  pleas tell!
