you need to start the x-server with -indirect it_name.

if you start it with -indirect localhost, it us the loopback adress as
it's adress. so when it try to contact anoth host, thi on try to answer
on it loopback adress. not good.

rememb that everi machin ha the adress 127.0.0.1 on the loopback network.
