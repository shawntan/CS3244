g'dai all,

i'm look for a program to convert bmp imag to gif, tga or even ppm.

i'd prefer a unix program, but do is fine also.

i've seen alchemi (for do) and some window imag viewer which can save
an imag in other format, but what i'm after is a convert not a viewer...

ani help would be apprieci!

cheer
stephen.
