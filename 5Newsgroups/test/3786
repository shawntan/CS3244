hmm, depend on how you defin 'clean'. jordan implement the system
depend stuff in a wai that you have basic implement for,
call it, oper system type, then you go ahead and write a includ
file for your specif machin or oper system us the basic
implement. sinc both jordan and i haven't encount a 
os flavor yet, that is fulli posix, we haven't gotten around to
realli implement (and test) a top-level includ file specif
for just posix. the posix routin ar us in the sun specif file
tty_sun.i for exampl, but here we also us some bsd stuff. all in all
it still is probabl better to implement a includ file for each and
everi oper system than '#ifdef'ing in exist on. the type
of mess that can result from that can clearli be seen in the xterm
sourc. even if quit a bit of code get copi almost unchang a 
coupl of time, thi onli us up some disk space, sinc onli the 
"driver" actual includ from the toplevel includ file will be 
compil into emu.

it shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fulli
reli on the posix stuff, but unfortun i don't have a linux
system avail to me, so i can't do the port myself. i would suggest
you read the readm in term/sysdep and if you have ani problem or
question, contact me and we could try to sort thi out. unfortun
we have to reli on help from the net on thi part of emu, sinc we 
just don't have access to that mani differ system.
