 i thought i'd repli to thi, though i ain't brad.  at ani case, a lot
of pictur-file viewer that will convert, sai, between .gif,etc, to
.bmp *will* convert to .rle.  i know for a fact that paintshop
(sharewar from cica; /desktop, i think, filenam psvvv.zip (i think,
where vvv is the ver. number.  if that's not true, let me know and i"ll
post a corect).


thi, howev, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extens, so you
have to renam it.

now, anoth thing....
thi is from the window' faq:

your file ha to be less than 64 k
( at least that's what the faq sai, but mine wont work for more than
about 30...mayb thei mend 32k, i don't know).

your file ha to fit vga size (480 * 860, or whatev standard vga size
is.)  if you us a non-vga screen (e.g. cga, ega, svga, there is also a
wai to do it, but i thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you us anoth file,
such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or someth.  i'm not sure about
thi, as i have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
window help ver. of which *is* avail at cica, but don't konw the
filenam). 

also....your .bmp ha to be 16 colour or less.

these spec rule out some of the good .bmp's.  i found cartoon draw
work quit well as thei have the advantag of look good with littl
memori.

final, rememb to save your current win.com befor, and put your
new win.com in the window directori.  also, don't start window from a
directori where anoth win.com is present, as *that* is us instead of
the on in the window dir, and win. won't start.


share thi fairli, but don't take a slice of my pie (pf).
