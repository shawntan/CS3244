i think the main reason is that in the good old hacker dai of the young(er)
gate' and job' of the world, the comput wa not as widespread a
phenomenom as it is now.  with the increas popular of the pc
come a plethora of mundan busi us which requir more practic
mind and narrow-focus programm.

why be a hacker when you can get a good job program databas or
program for account?  basic, the yuppi caught up and
disciplin the hacker, and mold them in their own imag.
