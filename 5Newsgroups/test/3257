adob streamlin ha been out four a coupl of year. it doe a much better
job than the autotrac function which ar built into illustr
program. of cours, a higher resolut bitmap will produc a more
accur trace. the problem that i've run into though, is that when it
creat a detail trace, it produc wai more point than ar necessari.
if i trace someth manual, i us mani less es point. the problem
with thi is it produc big file which slow everyth down, especi
print.
