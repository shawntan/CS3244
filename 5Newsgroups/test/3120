i believ that appl, sun and a number of other desktop machin
manufactur have agre with the govern to incorpor
power-save techniqu;  thi is also someth that govern in
other countri ar like to requir in the futur, so expect to see
it.  thi mai includ the abil for the system to fulli power down
the monitor, via a control power outlet, and power it back on
automat.  (is thi a "sell" on screen saver softwar compani?)

goal for "idl" power consumpt have been set at someth like 30
watt for the system, not includ the monitor (? don't quot me on
thi).

note that in mani busi, the save will be substanti,
especi if you factor in reduc load on air condit system.
sun did a studi that indic that simpli power off monitor for
the night would save the compani (sun itself) on the order of $1m per
year.  put other (and automat) power-save featur in would
probabl have greater than doubl that valu.

given that we ar see more and more reason to leav our work and
home comput on (get fax, automat get email, ...),
build power consumpt control into all machin ha a potenti to
cut ~2% off the nation power consumpt, base on data i heard.

btw: when encourag employe to power off monitor when leav
work, it wa point out that thi should onli be done with monitor
with the power switch on front.  there wa some indic that
monitor with power switch on the rear ar not design to toler
lot of power cycl.  thi mai onli appli to the monitor we us, but
might be worth check if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
in back.
