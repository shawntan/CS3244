i understood that there ar two method to connect applic code to widget:

                       callback and action

the problem i face now is that i have a quit long piec of applic code
that perform a lot of draw into a window. i want to connect thi to a
widget. no problem so far. i could us a callback function or an action to do thi, process ani event afterward.

but becaus the draw take some while, i want the applic code sequenc
to be abl to be interrupt by event. then i want to handl the event
and resum with process the applic code at the point it wa
interrupt.
it seem to me that thi isn't possibl, but how can i give the user the
impress that hi input ar immedi process ?

ha anybodi an idea?

pleas answer via e-mail.

thank in advanc.
