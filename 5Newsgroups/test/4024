my 66 dx2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
i am us the pc power and cool cpu cooler.  thi on ha
precis ball bear in the motor.  it ha a pretti substanti
heat sink; so if it happen to fail it would still probabl
dissip more heat than the bare chip.

it attach with peel off adhes.  thi is a full size at case, so
the fan ha graviti in it favor.  i would be a littl nervou about
find the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happen to let
go.

all of the cpu fan that i know of ar power from a drive cabl.
there ar other "board" type fan which ar isa board with a coupl
of fan mount on them.  thei ar power by the slot.  i  don't
know how effect thei ar; mayb someon els could comment.

the cpu is cool enough to touch with the pcp&c unit.

pc-connect at 800-243-8088 ha them for 29.95 + 5.00 next dai
deliveri.  the y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the
power suppli.  pcp&c make the best power suppli avail imho.
