hi all,

i've read the faq, i've fiddl around, but i am still have problem get
my poor old hp9000/300 to let me input/displai charact abov 127.  i have 
the follow in my .xdefault:

xterm*font     :   -adob-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1

so i believ that i have the correct font select to us in xterm.  i have not
set my lc_ctype environ variabl becaus whatev i put it, it tell me that
that local is not support (appar we have no addit local defin,
or at least, /lib/local doesn't exist).  i can get some of the charact
abov 127 to print out, but thei ar not where i'd expect them -- for exampl,
alt-v doe not produc a u umlaut.  thi lead me to believ that the fault
li with the stty set, which ar as follow:

speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>
intr = ^c; quit = ^\; eras = ^h; kill = ^k; swtch = ^@
eof = ^d; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^s; start = ^q
-parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crt 
-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc 
ixon -ixani ixoff -ienqak 
isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echo echok -echonl -noflsh 
opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofil -ofdel -tostop 

anywai, i've struggl with thi off and on for a coupl of week, and ani help
anyon could offer would be greatli appreci.


					thank!
