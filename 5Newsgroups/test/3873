 a few week ago i saw an ad in the german magazin c't
about a so-call videostream. thi is an interfac
between a pc's parallel port and ani video-record for
back up your data on a videotap. the compani (datasav?)
claim that it can store up to 7 gb on a 300 minut tape.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

it cost dm 250.- (about usd 200, i think)

my question is:
 doe anybodi us thi product, if ye, how mani byte 
 realli fit on a 300 minut tape (7 gb sound quit
 unbeliev to me). 

howev, ani comment on the interfac ar appreci.
pleas mail your repli directli to me, i will sum up
if neccesari. thank in advanc...
