i had thi problem when i initi instal my sound blaster pro and here's
what the tech support told me.

thei told me to look for the file that ar state in the readm file from
the win31 subdirectori of the soudblast directori. now look in the system.ini
file and if ani of them sai devic=xxxxxxx.386 than chang it to 
devic=*xxxxxxx
that should work. wa your system.ini file eras for some reason? that would
be the onli reason that i would think that windo is give you the error now.
