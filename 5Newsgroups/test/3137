so is there ani problem put a drive format vertic on
it side horizont?

i got a drive a few year ago with the rubber feet on the side,
etc. and have us it like that sinc (obvious design for that
orient). howev, it doesn't fit under ani of the clever
place i can think of to place it, so i would realli like to lai it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

thi is probabl not a "newer" drive, and it is onli 70 meg, but
when i bought it, it wa a larg drive for an averag user
(compar to bui a 200 meg drive todai). so is my old, 70 meg
drive as fragil (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?

just curiou.....
