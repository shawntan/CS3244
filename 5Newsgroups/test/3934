hi,

i recent got a tower-case for my gatewai 486/33 file server, mostli becaus
we need the extra drive bai and better power suppli.  thi case ha led's
for the processor speed, i.e. 33.  is there a place to plug thi in on the
motherboard?  if not, is there anywai to hack someth to make it work?

tia!
