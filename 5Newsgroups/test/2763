it's the applic that do thi.  unfortun, even the applet
that ship with win31 seem to have thi problem (i've seen it in
solitair, for exampl).

none that i know of.  if an applic doesn't give back the
resourc, thei ar lost and gone forev, pend a restart of
window.

if the applic don't free up the memori (and a lot of them
don't), there's bugger all that ani other piec of softwar can do
about it.

there ar book written on thi on.  in gener, just be sure to free
up everyth that you ask for befor you exit.  unfortun, i
understand that vb will *intern* lose resourc for you, so
there's no wai to avoid thi entir.
