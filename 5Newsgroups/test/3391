doe anyon know of ani c or c++ librari for prepar
and displai quickli page of mix text, mathemat equat,
and graphic (circl,ellips,etc) on the vdu? the math wouldnt
need to be up to tex qualiti, but it would be us to be scaleabl.
the main thing would be to be abl to gener the displai quickli
from a minimum set of format code.
thank,
