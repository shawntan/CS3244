vamilliron:  ye, intel's pci is (anoth) local bu standard, which
can be us for graphic, although i believ local buse can be us
for other thing, too.  as far as i know, though, pci local bu 
would compet with vesa local bu, not the vesa graphic standard, but
other more enlighten might be abl to shed more light on thi
matter.
