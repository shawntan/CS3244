hi!

we have an old montag fr-1 35mm film record. when connect to a pc with
it processor card it can directli take hpgl, targa and lasergraph languag
file. 24 bit targa is quit ok for raster imag, but convers from 
whatev on happen to have can be quit slow. thi lasergraph languag
seem to be (got the sourc file for on test imag) a vector-base languag
that can handl on million color. it doe some polygon too, and perhap
someth els ?

the question is, where can i find some inform about thi languag ?
a ftp site, a book, a compani address,.... ?

(ok, it would be nice to have a window driver for it, but i'm not that
optimist...)

thank in advanc for ani help!
