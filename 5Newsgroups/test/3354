if you read the last coupl of book in the seri close (well, #3 and #4
at least), there ar at least two point at which the real question is
impli.  convers proce much like:

zaphod: what *is* the ultim question, i wonder?
arthur (not pai much attent to zaphod, but need a random seed for
  the infinit improb drive): think of a number, ani number.

actual, it mai be marvin who us thi phrase a few time as well, and
everytim it's arrang such that "think of a number, ani number" could be
an answer to someon's question about the question.

i kind of like it.  veri mystifi.  it's not even "pick a number" or
"tell me a number", just "think of on".
