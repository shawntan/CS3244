would someon be will to explain to me the 486dx 50mhz is not more
popular than it is?  i would think it would be just as fast, if not 
faster than the 486dx 66mhz for certian applic.  plu, a 50mhz 
motherboard would seem better if you had ani plan on upgrad the
chip in the futur.  i must be miss someth, sinc everyon is 
bui the dx2 66...  mani add don't even mention the dx 50.

 thank a lot,
   -matt
