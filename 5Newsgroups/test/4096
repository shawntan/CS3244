which bu???

i think there ar sever reason :-

50mhz motherboard ar harder to get right
50mhz need a fast l2 cach - 12-15ns is a good idea
50mhz need to be slow down to make a compliant vesa bu
66mhz dx2 chip ar faster for a lot of thing


with a good, fast l2 cach a dx2/66 is go be be faster than a dx50...

what do i have?

a dx50 of cours!
