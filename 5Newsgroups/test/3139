line: 16

can someon tell me which of the file that come with dw-3.1 go where
and for what purpos?  what can be left out, for instanc, if
you don't want to do background print?

as far as i can rememb, all you need to do to get your deskwrit up and
print us the 3.1 driver is to drag the driver itself (either serial or
appletalk depend on your need) to the system folder. you don't need the
font or anyth els if all you want is straight forward, bare bone, basic
print....i don't have anyth els instal and can still print on a
deskwrit us sy7.1 and hp driver 3.1
