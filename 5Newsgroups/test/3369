recent we have found tiff manipul packag which do not recogn
tiff file output by xv.  thi is due to a miss xresolut and yresolut
tag which appar is requir (or at least believ to be requir) for
valid tiff.  i have check both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these
do inde copi these tag.

ha anyon out there hack in the fix for xv to support these tag?
i have been told that i could find some code in tiff/tool/tiffcp.c, but
that directori is on of mani of the tiff group not distribut with xv.  i
hope to obtain the origin tiff src and look at it, but would prefer
to find code alreadi known to work in xv.
