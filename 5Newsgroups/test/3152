    the origion bit is miss but long/short follow:

    the origion poster ask if he/she could us ani old vga/svga
monitor with a centri (henc titl).  

    the answer ot thi question is an unqualifi ye.  you can us ani
old vga/svga monitor with a centri.  you do need an adaptor (i us a
mac vga-q from jame engin (510) 525-7350) to run between the two
machin.  the adaptor i have mention will convert a centri to a
three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.

    now, the special interest disclaim.
 the abov answer is correct for us a vga monitor at 600x400
resolut.  if your monitor will sync to 56khz horizont the abov
adaptor will allow you to choos 800x600 resolut (i prefer thi on my
1604s).

then you have the question of match adaptor and sync rate.  i would
advoc call jame engin becaus thei seem to have a clue.  as
to the comment by the person who said don't bother call appl becaus
thei will treat you like an idiot thi is total untru.
    appl will treat you like a f**king assanin idiot for even
consid go third parti and if you want thi treatment want you
to pai for their thech support line (the supposedli compitantli on) and
then still ha no fu***** clue.

person experi.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor maker
doesn't see to extend to mac (soni, magnavox).  in addit to thi to
find out the info you will have to call dealer unless you can find the
sync rate elsewher as ad like hardwar that fit
(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolut give the most
favor rate (which usual mean you can get thi if you us a
special applic video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolut
1168x832 on thi $5,  9" "super smelli sock" monitor that will let you
displai two full page side by side.  all you need is our reason
price "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an
ultra fast horizont sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz
vertic.")



note:  with the soni 1604 at least on the centri 610 built in video
board us an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the
side of the imag after adjust the horizont width as favor as
possibl.  us a 800x600 adaptor thi can be reduc to about half an
inch.

                                                                    -a.
