i don't know which tube the viewson 17 us, but it ha an 82khz horizont
bandwidth so you can go pretti high.  i ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which wa as
fast as the orchid p9000 could drive it.  also, the 17 doe claim to be abl
to support 1600x1280, but i have no experi with that.

sinc i have the spec sheet in front of me i'll type some in:

crt:	17", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflect, rgb mediou short
	persis, tint (tm=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflect

input signal:  rgb analog 0.7vp-p, 75 ohm (also ha set for 1vp-p)
	sync: h/v separ(ttl), composit (+/-), sync on green (+/-)
	horizont freq: 30-82khz, vertic freq: 50-90hz
compat: pc from vga to 1600x1280 non-interlac, mac iici and abov
control: contrast, bright, posit, size, degauss, p-p voltag, color
	temp, sync select, color tune, moir on/off.
video band witdth: 135 mhz
max bright: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field
misconverg: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner
dimens: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight 42.6 lb

i don't know what some of those mean and don't verifi their accuraci, i just 
type them in.  other thing thei hype on the sheet ar a 'doubl quadupl
dynam astigmat focu'.  right.  thei mean thei us two lens.  advanc
invar shadow mask.  viewmatch color control which thei claim is and easi-to-us
system that adjust color to close match printer output.  as near as i have
been abl to figur out, thi translat to separ control for red, green,
and blue.  how thi make it easi to match for printer output is beyond me.

but beyond the hype, the monitor is veri pleasant to look at.  sharp, clear,
and isn't nearli as bad as the nec's for reflect.
