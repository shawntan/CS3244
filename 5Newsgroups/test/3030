sorri, thi must be a faq, but it's a quick fix that i need to take care of  
befor a demo in less than 24 hour from now! couldn't think of a better place  
for a rapid answer than comp.sy.mac.hardwar.

i need to connect the serial a of a compac 386/20 pc to the printer port of a  
mac iici. doe anyon have handi the pin-pin rout for the cabl that would  
allow thi connect? 

the serial port on the compaq is a male db9. how would thi map to the din8 of  
the mac serial? i tri on of those realli short femaledb9-maledin8 cabl  
that appl sold as adaptor to plug in macintosh serial peripher from the  
pre-macplu era. thi cabl didn't do it. do i need a null modem adaptor as  
well on the db9 side of thing? 

i just need to be abl to map the data tx and rx pin correctli.


thank kindli,
