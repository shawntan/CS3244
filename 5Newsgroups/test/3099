hi,
i'm have problem ty to get a soni dat drive to work.  i'm us
retrospect 1.3ci,
and my onli luck with get the drive to work ha been with a mac iici,
which ha
now unfortun gone to anoth depart.
  ideal, we want to attach it to our quadra 950 setup.  i can't seem to
get the
retrospect softwar to recogn the media at all.  when in the "devic"
dialog,
it can see the dat devic, but come up with, firstli, 'run', secondli
'media failur' and then immedi 'content unknown'.  thi doe not
happen with the
mac iici setup, which simpli sai 'readi'.
  i'm hope someon els will have had similar problem but found some
solut... i 
know some other who have had problem with dat devic and their quadra,
but thei have
a mac iici which thei can us!
  
the symptom
system softwar is 7.1, also didn't
work with 7.0.1
  i have tri the follow:
  turn off all extens, except retrospect scsi (requir)
  test on a varieti of machin:  quadra, iisi, and lc (at least).
  connect no other scsi devic
  test all varieti of scsi termin etc.
  replac the dat unit with a new on (ye!  we got that desper!)
  read the retrospect manual (even more desper :))

repli via email would be greatli appreci... thank in advanc. 
i'll post ani
solut to thi group.

cheer,
matt.
