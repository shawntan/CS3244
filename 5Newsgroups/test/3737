i am just begin to try us the athena toolkit and am have some problem 
get start.  i think that some file ar miss on the system, but there is
the possibl that thei ar just in a differ directori.  when i try to link
my program it can't find xtinitail, xtrealizewidget, xtmainloop, 
xtcreatemanagedwidget, or commandwidgetclass.  i've includ intrins.h and
command.h.  i also had a problem on compil with xtncallback but replac that with
a null in order to compil and see if there were ani other problem.  i haven't 
us a toolkit befor and thi is simpli an exampl i got from the manuel.  can
someon tell me where i might look for these call, that is, in what file not what
directori thei ar suppos to be under becaus the system manag doesn't believ
in standard directori and gener doe thing hi own wai.  (i am us unix)

thank you for your assist.
