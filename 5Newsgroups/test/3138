subject: re: why the drive speed differ??
line: 11

the most like explan mai have someth to do with the fact that a
greater densiti of inform exist on the larger capac disk drive than
the smaller on. if your run the drive on a mac i would recommend a
sharewar util call timedr which test seek, scsi throughput and
rotat speed. thi util should let you know what the differ ar
between the drive.
