i have the logitech hand scanner for the mac.  it us a scsi
interfac box that the standard scanner unit plug into.  i
have tri my friend's ibm hand scanner with the scsi box and
it work.  see if you can get logitech to sell you the scsi
box by itself.  warn:  most of the cost of mac handscann
is contain in the scsi interfac box, so it could run up
to around $200.  when i upgrad my old style scanner to
the new grai scale model, it cost $75; thei just gave me a new
scan head and softwar; the box wa the same.  the grai scale
scanner + interfac run about $300; make it around $200 for
the interfac.
