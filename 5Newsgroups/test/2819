*the number ar in percentag and ar in a decreas order.

what doe thi tabl tell you, if you frequent start and exit a
program that doesn't give back all of it's resourc, then you
continu lose these resouc.  therefor, onli open these program
up onc and leav them open.


btw:  mayb peopl can add to thi list so we know what applic to
watch out for.
 
later,
