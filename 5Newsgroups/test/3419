no, mi folk have infinit budget of death, and thei also get part
of their budget alloc "upgrad", "mainten", and "new purchas",
and a lot of ibm mainfram purchas ar actual "leas" and so
is the softwar.

basic, the engin who have tight budget, i.e. the coder and
design of a compani, bitch and moan when thei drop 15,000 on a 
sparc 1 onli to see a faster machin appear a year later.  mi type
upgrad onc everi 5-10 year, and their cost ar amort and
depreci over a longer period, and the budget offic justifi
the expens becaus thei actual us the machin for account,
payrol, etc.

now, if the budget offic wa depend on the engin for some
reason like payrol and account, you'd sure as hell see everi
engin with a new crai on hi desktop everi year. :-)
