on my pc i almost exclus run window. the onli do base applic  
i have is procommplu.  in my config.sy i have emm386 load with the  
option noem (no expand memori). follow a thread in on of the comp  
newsgroup, i read that it wa no necessari to have emm386 load. inde,  
in the manual, it sai that emm386 is us to get expand memori out of  
extend memori. sinc i have the noem option, it seem to me that the  
emm386 devic is useless in my case. 

should i us emm386 or should i remov it from my config.sy?

thank for your help,
