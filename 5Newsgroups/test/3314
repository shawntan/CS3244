           cornel theori center summer school
 
          offer through the cornel school of
        continu educ and summer session
 
                  cours descript
 
 within the past ten year, the  simul and  model of
line: 197

molecul ha evolv from an esoter academ subject into
a  intern  industri. comput  graphic ha plai  a
decis role in thi transform by allow chemist to
build, visual and interact with complex geometr object.
 
while comput scientist ar convers in the languag of their
own disciplin, thei ar often unfamiliar with the terminolog,
simul techniqu and practic need of research chemist.
similarli, chemist ar often unfamiliar with the latest paradigm
and technolog advanc in graphic comput.
 
thi interdisciplinari cours is intend to bridg the gap
between comput scienc and chemistri and to equip chemistri
research who wish to be more than just casual user of
prepackag graphic softwar. although thi is not intend to
be a cours in comput chemistri or drug design, data set
from chemic research problem will be us in lab and student
will be encourag to bring data set of their own. lab exercis
and project will be carri out us data-flow program
(ibm visual data explor softwar) and student will have
access to cornel theori center comput resourc, includ video
record equip.
 
audienc:  research and student in the chemic and biolog
           scienc interest in integr state-of-the-art
           comput graphic into their research; comput scientist
           wish to gain familiar with a major applic of
           scientif visual.
 
           the class size will be limit to 25 particip on a
           first-come first-serv basi.
 
level:     graduat/advanc undergradu, 1 or 2 credit. mai be taken
           without credit as a workshop. calculu, linear algebra
           and introductori chemistri requir. familiar with unix,
           x-window and c is us but not requir.

format
 
the cours will be held in the theori center train facil
where comput workstat will be avail.  daili lectur will be
interspers with laboratori exercis and ampl time will be provid
for project enabl and familiar with the new comput
environ. student enrol for on credit will be grade on the basi
of their laboratori exercis and short final project. those enrol
for a second credit will receiv more advanc lectur, be given
more time for project develop and meet daili to share experi
and discuss problem encount.
