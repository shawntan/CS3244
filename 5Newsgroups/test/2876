while i do not think he is ly, i also feel hesit to take anybodi "on their
word" unless thei can attribut a sourc for thier claim. with all the fud 
and misinform and misconcept and outright li fly around the 
advocaci newsgroup, i do not trust ani unsubstanti rumor or claim 
- especi from ani employe of ibm's or microsoft, or anyon who seem to
have a vest interest.
