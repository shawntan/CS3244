thing in "vi" from a sun rasterfil... what a pain!

for folk who haven't the slightest, it went like thi:

		how to make your own x-face:
		   in 0x000f easi step!

	1. scan my driver' licens into a *.pcx file.
	2. us wingif to 'trim' my face out of the licens,
		'reduc' it by half, and
		convert it to *.bmp.
	3. us paintbrush to touch up manual.
	4. us wingif to 'reduc' it by half again.
	5. us paintbrush to touch up again.
	6. us wingif to 'reduc' it by half *again*
		and convert it to *.gif.

		[now over to the unix side...]

	7. us snapshot to convert the *.gif to a sun rasterfil.
	8. us iconedit to touch it up and
		convert it to an x bitmap.
	9. us "vi" (ye, a *text* editor) to manual convert
		the rasterfil into the "uncompress x-face" format.
		(lot of global "ed" command, and by the time you're
		 done you'll mirror hex bytewis in your sleep!!)

		[now over to the *linux* side...]

	a. us "compfac" to convert it to what you see here:

 %:a<m@dob}bo"'e",eeqgbn7qy(en7as5u([k//"g{6^hibi9x8~+pd($}6szf"&vvxcxsn
 8mw^0g#nvhe%w,`x"[j0s{r.~%zs:o|hfu=lwzygh

	b. try view it by whatev mean you have avail.
	c. go back to step 9, but do it *right* thi time.
