it's definit date - i us os/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft wa
develop it...)

i prefer window 3.1 becaus it wa more stabl & faster than 3.0,
but could still run more app than os/2 (again i made thi choic
befor 2.0 wa releas).

no, i've seen no such data.

hmm. ar you sure?  i'm speak from my own experi as an
os/2 _user_. certainli peopl in, sai, the nt market group 
would be in a uniqu posit to present the result of, sai,
research on upcom nt and os/2 app (vs window and ms-do app).
part of my point wa that just caus on work at microsoft doe 
not mean on ha access to such data (if it exist).

i will confess to, at time, attack the poster.

again, my point wa that not all microsofti ar here to "sell" 
reader on our product (which would conflict with the "no-ad" 
philosophi of usenet).  nor do we necessarili have access to info
that other have.

i also get tire of peopl assum that microsofti ar, like,
member of the borg.
