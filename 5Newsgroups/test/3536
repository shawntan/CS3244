i am *almost* done port xfree86 1.2 to a new piec of displai
hardwar, but have run into a snag i think mai be somewhat
commonplac, so i'm send a net-feeler.

i have a displai that is a non-interlac, memori map, 1-bit
720x280 displai.  the server's view of the world, (obtain via xwd |
xwud), seem to be exactli what it should be.  howev, the displai
version of the framebuff give the impress that the server is
us scanlin that ar too long.  after a bit of experiment, it
seem that the problem wa that the server wa pad the line out to
a word boundri, but the scanlin size in the buffer is 90 byte, which
isn't exactli divis by four.  chang the follow defin in
mit/server/includ/servermd.h:

----

#defin bitmap_scanlin_pad  32
#defin log2_bitmap_pad		5
#defin log2_byte_per_scanlin_pad	2

---

to:

---

#defin bitmap_scanlin_pad  16
#defin log2_bitmap_pad		4
#defin log2_byte_per_scanlin_pad	2

---

wa not exactli the right solut.  how do i tell the server either
(a) don't pad the scan line at all ('caus thi server is onli be
built to run on thi particular displai), or to pad onli to byte
boundri?

i'm us a custom version of xfree86v1.2, under mach 3.0.

thank
brian
