i am work with visual basic v2.0 for window.
specif, i am work on an applic that gener format report.
sinc, some of these report can be rather larg, my first question is:

1.  is there a wai to increas the size of a list box or text box in
visual basic/window beyond the 64k limit?

as i have not (as yet - be optimist :-) come across a wai to get
around the abov problem, i am work on the follow approach:

i am try to creat my own defin templat in ms-word, us the
wordbas macro so that i can open up word from visual basic(vb) and load
thi templat of mine, which will work in the follow wai:

it will first open myown.ini file (creat in vb - at the time when the
user select the kind of report he weant) and read the section from the
.ini file and jump to the appropri code in templat - which will then
open and read a file pertain to the section it read from the .ini file.

1.  when us the getprofilestr function in wordbas, is there a wai
to specifi/chang the default .ini file (which is win.ini) to myown.ini file?

2. when us the file input$ function in wordbas - is there a wai to
read more than the 32k at on time?

ani help will be appreci.
