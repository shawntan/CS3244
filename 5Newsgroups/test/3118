    not without replac most of the chip on the motherboard. the c610
isn't like the iisi wa, mean that the motherboard of the c610 is 
actual design to run at the speed of the cpu, and not design to
run at a higher speed (like 25mhz) but be forc to run at the speed of
a slower cpu (20mhz).

    there is more than on oscil. if you ar talk about the cpu
oscil chip, i think that it is locat under the socket for the
'040. at least thi is what i have read in some other post in thi
group.
