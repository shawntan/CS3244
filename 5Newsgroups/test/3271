	i'm pretti sure most industri strength imag process specif

why? why not, oversampl is never a bad idea especi if the

	strang question, but anywai, there's the vgx line, the newer

can get a 24 processor system with twice the graphic perform of
a realiti engin). there's more, but i don't have my handi "period 
tabl of sgi's" on me...
