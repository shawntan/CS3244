i have the follow problem on a dell 450se with the ati graphic ultra pro 
eisa:

when i start window, the first 5 time i try to run an applic, it doe
not start. window will show the follow error messag:

   error execut applic. there is not enough memori to run the    
   applic.

after the first 5 tri, the applic i want to run will start, and 
afterward there ar no more problem. when i chang the video driver from 
mach 32 to 8514/a, thi problem doe not occur, so i suspect the ati 
driver (i tri both the build 55 and build 59 driver).

doe anyon have a clue?
