i  _do_ know  that  ibm system, the ps/2 56slc2, in  particular, have
absolut no  problem  with  os/2--never had  a "random" crash  while
run ani of  my program under  os/2.   in fact, i  don't  rememb
_ever_ crash.

of cours, i realli don't run ani  os/2 program, just the  same bunch
of do and window stuff that i've alwai been run.

and  when  i  had  the  56slc  (thi is  the  386slc  system)  run
do/window, i had onli  on crash, and it wa consist.   ftp had a
tendenc  to  crash  whenev  i would  get  larg  file (>1mb)  from
particularli fast  client  (dtr's  150k-200k/sec), i  figur out the
problem wa with smartdrv's write buffer--if i turn off the write
buffer, everyth would work fine.

ftp under os/2 ha never lock,  though.  i can even format  floppi
(to us the most often cite exampl of the superior of os/2.)

yeah, i guess i'm will to admit that os/2  is somewhat sensit to
specif hardwar.  wp51 for do work perfectli fine on my slc2...

well,  i save all  my  person file to floppi,  and when  i did that
under window, a floppi save of a larg file hung up the system.

i  also found  it quit bothersom to  have  to  continu tweak the
task option  on fractint for do whenev i want to do a fractal
comput in the background.

the idea is  that os/2's do session can see more memori than window
do  session.  i  let  xpl (a  sharewar calculu program) see around
720kb of free _convent_ memori, which let me  do bigger symbol
manipul than is possibl  under straight do (where it would see
around 610kb of convent ram.).  i  also found it realli handi for
my _own_ do-base program, which, without  ani re-write, could now
handl larger data set, simul for more iter, etc. of cours,
the  point is  now moot,  sinc  the os/2 program i now write  simpli
_never_ run into memori limit.  i never program  for window,
so i don't have much of a comparison here, though....
