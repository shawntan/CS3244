as an earlier post note - through dma.

| if we're talk isa (at) bu here, then you can onli have 1 dma channel
| activ at ani on time, presum transfer data from a singl devic.

ani on time mean imho a singl byte xfer. if i have four sourc of
dma request readi, the dma would servic the on after the other. if
the bandwidth for the four togeth is lower than the isa/dma
bandwidth, thi will work.

note that the bu master here is the prioriti mechan in the dma
control.
