do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the do displai and then back or 
creat a temp. do window?

if ye then i might recommend winzip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  i'm afraid 
i don't have the file name or version but you should be abl to find it.

it's fulli compat with ver. 2.04g and veri function.

later,
