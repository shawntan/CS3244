microsoft is the largest softwar compani on the planet, yet i cannot think
of even *on* comput concept that thei innov and brought to market
befor anyon els.  xerox-parc/appl, osborn, next, gnu and other have 
been pioneer and led the wai to the futur of comput.  what ha
microsoft done to be a technolog leader?  i post thi question befor,
but i got nari a repli.  i make the challeng now to anyon who can come up
with someth-especi microsoft employe.  i get no respons thi time,
i guess it pretti much assur me that there is none--which is what i
suspect anywai.
