	   i don't think the question is:
		   "will os/2 x.x run window y.y app now?"

	   a more import question is:
		   "will subsequ os/2 version continu to run app
		   from subsequ window version in the futur?"

	but the most import question is:
		"will there be ani os2 app, so we don't 
		have to load window in the futur?"
	
	and mayb the question of the futur will be:
		"will window x.1 run os2 y.y app now?"
