	greet,
	we have a network of ~20 sun workstat, run suno 4.1.1
and openwindow 3.  7 of these ar sun 3's that we have modifi to
run seth robertson's xkernel imag, effect turn them into
xtermin.  we us xdm (x11r4) to manag the displai.

	when we had 3 xkernel machin, thing work fine, but when
we instal 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weak.
with 7 client to 1 sparc 2, the sparc 2 window manag is eventu
get mung.  

	let me try to be precis:  the user sit at the machin
that doe all the actual process for these xtermin is have
control of hi keyboard and screen yank awai.  (when thi wa the
depart chair, it wa kind of cute).  we poke at xdm for a few
dai and ar satisfi that it is not at fault.  our current theori is
that olwm (the sun version) wa not meant for run multipl copi
on on machin (which is what happen -- the consol user run olwm,
and everi xtermin log in ha olwm run on the xtermin
server). 

	ha anyon had ani prior experi with thi sort of behavior?
	can anyon shoot obviou hole in thi theori?
	how about obviou gimm?
	and, of cours, ani idea on how to solv it?

	ani idea ar greatli appreci.
