i hook up an old 40meg extern mac hardriv to a powerbook 230.  i 
reformat the drive, copi all the file from the powerbook except the
systemfold, delet the file from the powerbook (my biggest error, sigh)
and then reboot the whole set up and... chime of death.
i get the follow sad mac error, 
00000f
000003
i ran norton and it claim it a bad scsi driver and suggest replac it.
i us appl disk tool but i couldn't updat the hardriv scsi driver
as it claim it wa in us, but i couldn't even mount the thing (though
i could see it when check the scsi bu, after turn it on after boot
my machin first).
