ibm, appl, motorola readi to unwrap powerpc 601 processor


the wrap will come off the powerpc 601 processor thi week, as motorola
corp., ibm, and appl comput inc. detail the result of their yearlong
effort. thi first in a seri of powerpc processor will be a 32-bit
processor with a 64-bit memori interfac, much like intel corp.'s
pentium, with the capabl of perform as mani as three instruct
per clock cycl, accord to sourc familiar with the chip. motorola
is expect to releas the chip in volum by year end in two
configur, run at 50 and 66 mhz with perform of 40 and 50
specint89 mark, respect, sourc said. float-point perform
for the 3.6-volt processor will be even better, as their specfp89
perform will be 60 and 80, respect. the 601, a scale-down
version of the power 220 chip develop by ibm for it rs/6000
workstat, will also includ a 32k singl buffer cach on the chip
with protocol to support motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bu
built in. the chip, which is be design initi to support the
micro channel architectur, is bu independ, so vendor could develop
powerpc- base system us a number of differ architectur,
includ isa, eisa, or sun microsystem inc.'s s-bu design, on sourc
note.

accord to sourc familiar with the develop effort, motorola ha
been extrem success in develop the powerpc as an inexpens
architectur, despit a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
transistor us a 0.6-micron technolog. initi chip ar expect to
be price from $300 to $400 -- onli slightli higher than intel corp.'s
486 processor -- but could be sold profit for less than $100, on
sourc said.
