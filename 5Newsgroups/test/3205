thi is a bad idea. my machin is on 24 hour a dai, but it's actual 
_do_ thing 24 hour a dai. i us it as an all purpos alarm clock, 
schedul, i've got routin that run in the middl of the night, phone 
call it make dure the dai when i'm out. if your machin is _on_ 24 hour 
a dai, then you can count on it to be _work_ 24 hour a dai. i could call 
it from work and download a file that i might need, i could call it from 
work and have it turn the light on if i'm go to be late (oop, more 
wast electr -- but convers, i could have it turn the light 
_off_). heck, i suppos i could even connect the microwav and have dinner 
readi when i get there.

oh well. nevermind. i'm just babbl.
