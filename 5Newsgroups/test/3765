sorri, that's a featur.  the icccm specifi how the app should set it titl, so the wm is oblig to do it.  if thi bother you, complain to the app writer.

write your own wm that doesn't support the icccm.  or write an program that you give a window id and a titl.  the your program can set the window titl for the app and then if the app chang it, your program switch it back again.
