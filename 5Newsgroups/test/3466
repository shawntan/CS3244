     or workstat

     mani other client and server have been develop by other, the
     follow is an attempt at a comprehens list.  

      a microsoft window winsock client "the gopher book"
        sunsit.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-window/winsock/goph_tbk.zip

      a macintosh applic, "macgoph".

         job.ac.ohio-state.edu:xgopher_client.share


     * note: these macintosh client requir mactcp.

     most of the abov client can also be fetch via a gopher client
     itself.  put the follow on a gopher server:

       type=1
       host=boombox.micro.umn.edu
       port=70
       path=
       name=gopher softwar distribut.
