call phoenix.  thei can put you on line with replac bio chip.  i had
to do thi when i upgrad a emerson 386/20 to an id drive.

also, if you ar instal an id drive, and there is a bio set that
ha a total volum the same as the id drive's volum, try us it.  the
id drive can usual respond to a varieti of differ geometri, as long
as the set that you us is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size.  the control will do the necessari translat automat, in
most case.

warn!!!  do not us a bio set that is even on byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  a smaller set will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorri if you go even on byte over.  drive damag will not
result, but headach will!
