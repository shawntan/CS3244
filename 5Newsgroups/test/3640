     you  should  try  have  a  .xsession  script in $home to do these
thing.  xdm will  start  up  your  process  us  the  system  version
(usual /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xsession), which should check whether you have
your won and chang to that if you do.  (take a copi of the  system  on
and edit it). 

     note, that thi file requir "x" access to be set.
