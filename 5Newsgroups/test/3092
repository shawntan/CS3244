i had mention in a previou articl that i wa search for the 300 extern
drive.  i did call appl catalog as recommend and thei told me the drive
were back order until mai 8.  i place an order anywai and two dai later
i had a visit from feder express.  well, you can guess how i spent my weekend.
of cours i end up pai list price but you do get a free copi of pc exchang
when you order from the appl catalog.  you mai want to check if thei have ani
intern drive.

btw, an older version of gatekeep (i don't recal which version), hung up my
mac when try to access a photocd or audio disk.  i got the newer version
which did mention a conflict with the appl 4.xx cd driver.
