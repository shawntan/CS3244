or perhap you write a freeli avail, gpled unix for commonli
avail comput platform (i386/i486 machin) and becom a catalyst
for a major netwid project which produc a better unix-like os than
mani commerci counterpart (see comp.os.linux for detail).  or mayb
you found a legu for program freedom to fight restrict litig
and softwar patent practic, therebi protect the creativ freedom
so vital to continu progress in our field.  or mayb you start up
a gnu project, and produc by far and awai the best c/c++ compil
for unix there is, not to mention other valuabl util.

some hacker make signific contribut without sell out their
ideal.  as for bill gate, after pawn of grossli inferior softwar
onto the pc market for ten year, if he ever wa a hacker, he deserv
to have hi name erad from the annal of comput hackeri.

as for me, i like run linux+x+countless other packag, without
pai a dime.  on the other hand, i have no problem purchas motif
or other good softwar, as long as microsoft hasn't foul it with their
inept input.

my 2 cent worth, flame will be patient ignor. :-)

jean.
