hello,

i saw thi question post a week or so ago, but as far as i could tell no
answer appear on the net. what is the good oil on connect the appl
extend keyboard to a powerbook? the earlier question wonderd if thi would
be too much of a load for the pb and as i want to connect just such a beast i
am curiou.

i haven't got a pb yet so i can't rtfm but i assum that a standard keyboard
with a mous would be ok as the spec sheet i read mention connect an
extern keyboard. but is the extend plu mous push it?

ani help gratefulli reciev. i will summaris to the net if necessari.

thank, john collin.

p.s. i am think of a pb160 but i assum that thi would appli to all pb's.
