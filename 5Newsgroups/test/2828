you must of read too mani os/2 advertis.  "crash protect" is such
a market gimick, it isn't funni..  out of 4 month of us window on my 
new machin i've onli had it crash onc, and i don't have a "run of the mill"
configur.

microsoft is not a leader in innov, but thei certainli know how to 
build a better mousetrap.  now, what's wrong with that??
