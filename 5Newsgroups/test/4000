i had on and on three differ motherboard it didn't work with nt and
in some case do. i sent mine back, but it is my understand that
on some system such as micron motherboard it is necessari to
shut off the intern cach on the 486 to have it work.

i've yet to hear from someon run a 34f on ani motherboard with
nt without shut off the cach.

if you get on my advis it to be veri sure you can return it first.
