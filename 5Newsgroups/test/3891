i have been us both id (or mfm) and scsi drive for year.  i have 2
id and 1 scsi on on system and the other with 2 id, 2 scsi disk, and 
1 scsi cdrom.  i current us alwai in2000 scsi card, but i also have
a futur domain, a western digit scsi card, and i work with an adapt 
befor.  as i recal, all these card can support boot and floppi drive.
howev, to us with other control (id, mfm...) the boot drive ha to
be the id (or mfm).  you can not boot from the scsi if you have other 
control in the system.  if you gui onli have 2 drive (1 id, 1 scsi).
just set up the id in your cmo setup.  make sure you can boot from it.
then, set up the scsi control (irq, dma, etc). set the scsi drive to 
id 0.  just plug and plai for all the card i seen so far.  onli if you 
have more than 2 drive then you need driver for the third drive and so
on.  if you have more question, email me, i will try to answer it.
good luck!
