you ar pervert.. ok vi is not cua but it ha a power set of command.
on for all it ha 26 separ clipboard (and not onli on ofor all kind of
data like window doe).
the onli problem is to know the command (the keyboard shortcut).
i am quit fast with the pc keyboard... and i usual us all finger to digit
so when i us a editor i do not want to leav the keyboard and us the mous
everi time i need a special function on the menu or to us the arrow kei
that ar awai from the usual posit of my hand on the keyboard......
in my situat vi is veri power and i'm search to a vi editor 
for window....
bye
p.s. sorri for the bad english....
