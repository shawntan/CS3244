why is win 3.1 sometim so finicki?
i have a new dell 486dx2/66mhz  8 meg ram.
window wa work just great.  i had a bu mous and mother board problem.
dell replac the mous, gave me a newer mous driver for window
and replac the motherboard.  just prior to thi problem window would
]onli load up everi other time.  i would get the logo and either it would
go on into window or lock up.  thi wa veri consist everi other time.

now with the new motherboard and all, it still doe the same thing.
the comput is less than on month old.  at first it work fine!
i can get into window each time now with the   win/s command.
thi forc standard mode.  thing seem to run slower.  i mainli
us window app, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem.....
plu it is slower.

i re-load window, it still doe the same thing.  should i first delet
everyth in all window dir's?  i did not becaus i have so much 
ad in sub dir's etc.

realli puzzl why enhanc mode would not load each time but consist
everi other time.  standard mode each time......
