 mirror is on of those do command that didn't surviv the chang 
 from do 5.0.  it's been drop, along with backup, join, edlin  
 and a coupl other crummi old do command.  you can still us the
 5.0 command if you absolut have to, but thei ar not includ
 on the 6.0 distribut disk.

 howev, in mirror's case, i'm 99.9% certain that it doe not know
 anyth about doublespac drive...
