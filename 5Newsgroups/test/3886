thi is a fundament aspect of novel's busi; thei wouldn't be
where thei ar if thei didn't live up to their "novel doe print"
slogan.  we run 6 printer of vari type off our novel network;
i'm sure there ar place with hundr.

rtfm on the captur command, printcon, pserver, and the section of
the window 3.1 manual which cover network print.  if you haven't bought
novel's product yet, rephras your question and look for inform about
how *well* variou competitor do print.
