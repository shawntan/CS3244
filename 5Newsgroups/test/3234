        interest, as i think comput technolog is now
becom widespread enough now that it is no longer a posit
which must requir a degre.  i know of sever peopl i work
with that make just as much as i do and thei don't even have
a bs degre in comp sci. yet thei make 28+ a year.  thei also
didn't have to pai 30 grand to thier local univers either. :(
       i think comput program is be reduc to a trade
practic, than a truli specialti field.  it will be even more
so in the futur.
       if your interest in cut edg type of stuff and you
choos cs as i did, i suggest check out the emerg field
of softwar engin.  the difficulti for exampl of design
scaleabl design environ for individu so that a singl person
can handl 100,000 to 1,000,000 million line of code all by himself
in a reason manner and then incorpor that into a teamwork enviro
is truli a gigant problem...not go to be solv ani time soon
unfortun...but hei you could be the person that provid
the miss kei for some good groundwork!

well, if your like the poor slob in the world..like me, you ar
in no financi posit to continu graduat work right out
of a top 10 comp sci school.

the trick is, to find some gener inc you work for to pai for the
rest of your educ...trust me it the best wai to go..even
if you don't get a top salari.  which i have alwai been a poor
slob throughout school but if you follow thi rule: book=salari=food&shelter
you should alwai have a comput and you won't go hungri.

what els could a man want?!
