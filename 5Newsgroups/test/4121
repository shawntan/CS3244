i have a 105mb id drive and am have a few problem! i get 
'data error on drive c' messag when read some file. the problem is
also steadili get wors.

i have run some diagnost softwar (pctool v7.1) and it sai that the
drive is ok - but it doe have to retri some sector and it briefli 
flash up an error messag (which is too quick to read).

doe anybodi know of ani cheap or free softwar which could mark these
sector as bad (do doesn't) or prefer perform a low level format.
i have heard that the latter is possibl on an id. technic answer
would be appreci. it would be nice to be abl to us the disk again!!!

i am run ms-do 5 on an at clone.
