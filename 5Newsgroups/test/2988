well, a few thing might help you like the 3.1 file manag better.

1) to get more than on window simpli doubl click on a drive icon.
   that it onli give you on window to work with is a fallaci. you
   can drag file between window, to ani icon on the tree on the left
   side of the window, and to ani drive icon. thi beat your "left
   and right window" as you can have as mani open as you wish instead 
   of just two.

2) you can launch ani app from within file manag by doubl click
   on the execut's icon.

3) you can launch ani applic and open a document file by doubl
   click on the document file's icon, provid you have
   associ set correctli. thi is easili done with the menu. the
   "brows" capabl add a lot of function to 3.1. so if you
   name all your text file with .txt and point all gif, tiff, etc.
   file toward paintshop or wingif, thi take care of your
   requir for "text read and graphic view".

i know someon who prefer us file manag as hi shell. set up
all the associ you need is the wai to do it.

if directori opu is half as good as file manag then it must be
pretti good inde! file manag just need you to understand how
some thing ar done.
