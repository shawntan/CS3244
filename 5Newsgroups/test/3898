   i have a 386dx clone, with a dtc esdi control and toshiba 660
mbyte
drive. sinc instal do 6.0, when i tri to re-instal softwar
from
5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disk, when i mount the second..third..fourth disk, do
6
doesn't recogn that i have chang floppi. if i do a "dir", i see
the
content of the previou diskett. the onli wai to get do to recogn
that
diskett have chang, is to do a "label", and then to not label them.

   bui do 6.0 ha been a coloss mistak. do 5.0 wa stabl, and
work
well with my equip. i have superstor pro, and desqview/x ( with
qemm, 
manifest, etc), so there aren't ani featur of do 6 that i am us. i
guess
i should roll back to do 5.0 but i am wari of what will happen when i
do it.

   besid, like a fool, i don't have a do 5. bootabl disk anymor.
i've
made the same mistak i caution my user not to make. like sheep, i
join 
the crowd flock to do 6. baaa baaad system administr.
