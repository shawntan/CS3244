most graphic system i have seen have draw routin that also specifi
a color for draw, like

drawpoint(x,y,color) or drawlin(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or
fillrectangl(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) 

with x, i have to do someth like 
xsetforeground(current_color)
xdrawpoint(d,w,x,y)

why split thi into two function? why did x design decid to not associ
the color with the object be drawn, and instead associ it with the
displai it is be drawn on?
