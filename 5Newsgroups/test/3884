gcc and other big program seem to crash about 15% of the time for me.
gcc gave someth like "program as got fatal signal 11" and when do
anyth past the complex of elvi, kermit, etc, i got kernel gener
protect fault at *least* onc a session.

i disabl my cach as suggest, and bingo, linux is as stabl as a rock
(it hasn't given me a core dump or kernel error yet).

doe ani on know why the cach would do someth like thi?
