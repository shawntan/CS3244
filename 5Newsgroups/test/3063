repost - due to net problem

hi,
   i have problem with the fdhd on a iicx that ekg report is rom
revis 376. i had report that thi mac wa have troubl 
format disk and by the time i got to it, the fdhd just would
not respond although all other function were fine.

i check the voltag on the db19 extern drive connector and pin
6 show no volt with 7 and 8 give 25volt unload. the power 
suppli is an astec and i sent it awai for repair.

with the power suppli reinstal, i now get the follow error:

with the intern fdhd connect, the mac boot fine but on complet
of boot cycl an alert displai "the disk is unread - do you
want to eject it?". for everi combin of respons, the alert 
reappear within approx 2 second and thi error is continu. the
fdhd doe spin but there is no head seek and the fdhd is incap
of eject the disk. thi error sequenc occur regardless of whether
there is a floppi in the drive or not. pin 6 on the db19 extern 
connector show 1.2v, pin 7 and 8 show 10.75v.

with the intern fdhd disconnect, the mac boot fine and work great 
(macekg report no error). the db19 extern connector now show
no voltag on pin 6 but pin 7 and 8 show 10.75v.

now, the intern fdhd mai be fubar, but i have an appl 800k extern
drive that give exactli the same symptom as the intern drive when
connect to either the extern db19 or the intern connector at j16
(after suitabl surgeri to the extern drive). the voltag at j16 
(with the intern fdhd disconnect) ar as follow:

	pin	volt	pin	volt
	1	-	2	5
	3	-	4	5
	5	-	6	5
	7	-	8	-
	9	-	10	5
	11	-	12	-
	13	10.75	14	5
	15	10.75	16	5
	17	10.75	18	-
	19	10.75	20	5

diod and pica fuse and can find no problem. doe anybodi have ani
