1) is it reliabl?

2) how doe it send the inform from a ms window app over
the x11 protocol? doe it just draw everyth as graphic into
on window, or doe it us multipl window and essenti work
more cleverli?

3) if i want to run ms word, for exampl, remot, do i have to
run a separ copi of ms window remot, and then start ms
word from that, or can ms word be start remot on it own?
